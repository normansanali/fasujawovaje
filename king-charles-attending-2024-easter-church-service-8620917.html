Charles' presence at the event is a major one, as it marks one of his most significant events he's attended since revealing that he was being treated for an undisclosed form of cancer. His presence, per the outlet, is being taking as "an encouraging sign about his health."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Senior royal members of the royal family are also expected to be at the event, however, Prince William, Kate Middleton and their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, will not be present at the church service.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">William and Kate taking a step back from the event — an important one in the royal calendar — comes amid her revealing on March 22 that she had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer while she was recovering from abdominal surgery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London, and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous," she explained in her announcement video. "The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team, therefore, advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy, and I’m now in the early stages of that treatment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Middleton added that she hopes the public will respect her privacy as she received treatment, and plans to make a return when she's better. "We hope that you’ll understand that as a family, we now need some time, space, and privacy while I complete my treatment," she said. "My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy, and I look forward to being back when I am able. But for now, I must focus on making a full recovery."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to her announcement, she was expected to return to her royal duties after Easter, which falls on March 31.
