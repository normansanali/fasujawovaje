Many viewers found the scene to be graphic and unnecessary, and took to Twitter to criticize Bailey’s career decisions in the wake of her recent controversial musical collaboration with Chris Brown."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I was doing my job and people kinda gotta remember I’m an adult and I’m an artist and nothing was seen that they haven’t seen from me.”</p><p></p><p>The 24-year-old went on to say that the point of that scene was to show the tension between Khalid and Marissa’s sister, Dre (Dominique Fishback), who was knowingly watching the pair have sex from the doorway, but perhaps viewers must not have picked up on that.</p><p>The drama comes after Chloe Bailey experienced swift backlash for working with <a href=# rel=noopener>Chris Brown</a> on her new song “How Does It Feel” due to the singer’s <a class=underline-link href=#>history of domestic violence</a>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“We’re failing Black women in music if they feel like they have to collaborate with a known abuser in order to chart,” one person tweeted before listing off numerous other male R&B singers she could have worked with, including&nbsp;<a href=#>Bryson Tiller,</a><a href=# rel=noopener>Lucky Daye</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=#>Brent Faiyaz</a>.</p><p>“We will absolutely not be streaming,” another person wrote. “Catch you next time though.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Most notably, 3LW and Cheetah Girls singer Kiely Williams criticized Brown directly, accusing him of being a woman abuser.</p><p>“let him come out with his own record – so genius so captivating that it makes us all forget HE BEATS WOMEN. He can’t so we won’t. So what does he do?” Williams wrote on Twitter. “He slowly creeps back into the mainstream by getting small nods for features on Black Women’s merit.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/03/donald-glover-faces-backlash-for-directorial-treatment-of-swarm-star-dominique-fishback-250x142.png alt="Donald Glover Faces Backlash For Comments About 'Swarm' Star Dominique Fishback" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Donald Glover Faces Backlash For Comments About 'Swarm' Star Dominique Fishback</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>March 22, 2023</p></a><p>She added: “Black women who are more talented, more worthy, but give him the okay.
