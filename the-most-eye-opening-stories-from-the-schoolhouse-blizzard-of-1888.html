So did tales of people who perished steps away from safety, per the <a href=#>MinnPost</a>. These accounts underscored the devastating irony of the blizzard, which saw many die on the veritable threshold to safety. The wide-open nature of the prairie, with few landmarks or markers of any sort, exacerbated the confusion of the storm as people attempted to navigate the frozen landscape.</p><p>After her husband, Knut Knutson, didn't return from Rushmore, Minnesota, where he'd traveled for extra supplies, Seselia Knutson, a Norwegian immigrant, felt increasingly anxious. Fearing he'd been caught alone on the plains by the storm, she decided to go looking for him. Had Seselia Knutson grown up in the region, perhaps she would've known to take extra precautions, like tying a rope around her waist so that she could get back to her starting point. But she never stood a chance. Tragically, Seselia Knutson died 40 steps from her front door, having attempted to shelter under a sled. She wasn't alone.</p><p>Like Knut Knutson, Hanley Countryman headed out on the morning of January 12&nbsp;to take full advantage of the balmy weather. He fortified his supply stores, securing 40 pounds of provisions to carry home. When the storm hit, Countryman was likely already tired from hiking with the heavy load. He attempted to go on, probably becoming disoriented. Finally, he laid down to die a mere 150 yards from his doorstep.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kGpubmpjZMGpsYympqysXZrGpnnOqZynoZ6cerTAzqugnqtdm7%2BwuYytn55lo5i1sLvLoaauq5Vir6212bOYq5xdpLNufZdxb2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
