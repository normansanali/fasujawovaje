It was co-created by Martin and John Hoffman, who produced the Netflix series “Grace and Frankie.” Gomez and “This Is Us” creator Dan Fogelman are executive producers on the show.</p><p>But as many people know, the two stars have a long list of other accolades.</p><p>Martin has won an Academy Award, five Grammy awards, an Emmy, the Mark Twain Award and the Kennedy Center Honors. He began his career on “The Smother Brothers Comedy Hour,” but then went on to perform for “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” and “Saturday Night Live. Martin is most widely known for his roles in a long list of popular movies, including “The Jerk,” “Roxanne,” “Parenthood,” “Father of the Bride,” “Bowfinger” and “Cheaper by the Dozen.”</p><p>Short has won three Emmys, a Tony, Theatre World Award, an Outer Critics Circle Award and he was awarded the Canadian equivalent to British knighthood- “the Order of Canada.” He has appeared in TV, film and theater since his start on “Saturday Night Live” more than 30 years ago. Most recently, he’s appeared on TV in “Big Mouth,” “The Morning Show,” “Hairspray Live!” and “How I met Your Mother.</p><p>“The Dukes of Funnytown!” ‘is a joyous and self-deprecating romp from two masters of comedy who are driven to make each other laugh as much as the audience,”‘ Live Nation said in its news release Monday.</p><p>The show will also feature special guests Jeff Babko and The Steep Canyon Rangers.</p><p>Denver 7+ Colorado News Latest Headlines | October 16, 11am</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8a5a6f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2460x400+0+0/resize/1280x208!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Fa4%2F513217a74767b21c0e4506bb0026%2Fd7-follow-up-bar-2460x400final.png"><p>The Follow Up</p><p>What do you want Denver7 to follow up on?
