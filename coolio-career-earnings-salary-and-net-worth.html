He was arrested for bringing a weapon to school and was sentenced to prison for larceny. As his life in Compton deteriorated in the 1980s, he became addicted to crack cocaine, but he quit after spending time in San Jose with his father. Before becoming a rapper, he worked in jobs such as volunteer firefighting and security at Los Angeles International Airport after attending Compton Community College.</p><p>Coolio released “Gangsta’s Paradise” for the film Dangerous Minds in 1995, featuring R&B singer L.V. It went on to become one of the most successful rap songs of all time, spending three weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. It was the No. 1 single in all genres in the United States in 1995 and a global hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, “Gangsta’s Paradise” was the second best-selling single of 1995. Coolio also claimed that comedy musician “Weird Al” Yankovic had not asked for permission to make his parody of “Gangsta’s Paradise,” titled “Amish Paradise,” which caused a stir. The song earned Coolio a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.</p><h2>What is Coolio’s net worth?</h2><p>Coolio was a Grammy-winning American rapper and actor who died with a net worth of $1.5 million.</p><h2>How much does Coolio make a year?</h2><p>His income per year is not known</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51ksLC7y6KmZpuRp7KmvoyemKummaO0tHnSmqOaqqlirq%2BwjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
