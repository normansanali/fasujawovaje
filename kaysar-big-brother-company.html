He added, &#34;This is Big Brother.

I'm gonna figure out a way to get out of this mess so that you'll be seeing me next week in this house."</p><p>TBH, Kaysar is doing just fine outside of Big Brother. He's super skilled and has a great job in Newport Beach, Calif. Here's a little bit more about Kaysar's work and what he does outside of Big Brother.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>No matter what happens tonight I appreciate all the love and support. <a href=#>#BB22</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nfW4nRzTjR</a></p>— Kaysar Ridha (@KaysarRidha) <a href=#>September 3, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What's Kaysar's company?</h2><p>Kaysar is the Vice President of Digital Product at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolus</a>, a platform that connects you with beauty experts in the medical and wellness industry. Their slogan is: Performance Beauty, your way. Evolus also sells a physical product, Jeuveau. Jeuveau is described as "a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used in adults for a short period of time (temporary) to improve the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines)" on the site. So, pretty similar to Botox (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here's an explainer</a> on the differences between the two).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Evolus</span></figure><p>You can just use Evolus to find specialists in the beauty/medical sector, like plastic surgeons, an RN at a medical spa, and aestheticians in your area. The kind of work you can get done ranges from injectables, to tattoo removal, to laser treatment.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Evolus</span></figure><p>Kaysar's job has less to do with physical aesthetics and more to do with the functionality of the site. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His LinkedIn </a>states he has 10 years of tech experience, reading, "Branding, Mobile, Web, User Experience Design and Direction — Over 10 years of professional expertise in the technology industry helping both start-ups and Fortune 500 companies to strategize, define, and design web and mobile products and applications."&nbsp;</p><p>The Big Brother contestant was previously the co-founder and chief product officer of Dubai-based company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zbooni</a>, which is a chat-based invoicing platform. It looks like Kaysar left before the company decided to either go public or get acquired. The most recent financial news we have is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zbooni raised $1.1 million</a>. Back in 2015, Kaysar worked at Facebook as a product designer.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">People are pretty emotional about Kaysar's eviction on Big Brother.</h2><p>Swaggy C even tweeted, "Kaysar.
