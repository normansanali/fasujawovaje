Still, the news of their engagement is extremely low-profile. The couple has been <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>together</strong></a> since <i>December 2018</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/23/KyrieMarlene-1608718618009.jpg><p>In <i>September 2019</i>, Marlene was spotted with a beautiful engagement ring.
