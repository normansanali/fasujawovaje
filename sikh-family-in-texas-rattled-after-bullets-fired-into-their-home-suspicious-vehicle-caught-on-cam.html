We didn’t expect this.”</span></p><p><span>The Harris County Sheriff’s Office (HCSO) previously probed the incident. The case has been transferred to investigators for a follow-up investigation.</span></p><p><span>“It appears that the projectile came from the roadway feeder or along the Beltway 8,” an HCSO spokesperson told </span><span>KHOU 11</span><span>. “There is a wooded area south of the homes before the feeder. No nexus for them being targeted, though they are Sikh.”</span></p><p><span>While Singh initially believed the sheriff’s examination, another family member noted a suspicious vehicle captured on their surveillance cameras at around 11 p.m., 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. before the shooting occurred.</span></p><p><span>“It doesn’t add up,” Singh said. “You could hear the footsteps. You could feel the shots are really close to the house.”</span></p><p><span>Singh said his family have never received threats, but they are worried as members of their community have previously been targets of crime in their neighborhood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We gotta sleep with one eye open, you know?” Singh said.</span></p><p><span>The Sikh National Center hosted a community meeting to provide support for the affected family on the night of July 5.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The concern in the community has been building as these episodes of ignorant people doing ignorant things,” Dr. Hardam Singh Azad, the chairman for the Sikh National Center, reportedly said.</span></p><p><span>Anyone with information on this incident is urged to contact the Harris County Texas Sheriff’s Office at 713-221-6000.</span></p><p><span>Featured Image via KHOU 11</span></p><h3>Support our Journalism with a Contribution</h3><p>Many people might not know this, but despite our large and loyal following which we are immensely grateful for, NextShark is still a small bootstrapped startup that runs on no outside funding or loans.</p><p>Everything you see today is built on the backs of warriors who have sacrificed opportunities to help give Asians all over the world a bigger voice.</p><p>However, we still face many trials and tribulations in our industry, from figuring out the most sustainable business model for independent media companies to facing the current COVID-19 pandemic decimating advertising revenues across the board.</p><p>We hope you consider making a contribution so we can continue to provide you with quality content that informs, educates and inspires the Asian community.<br><span class=donate_way><strong>Even a $1 contribution goes a long way.</strong></span> Thank you for everyone’s support.
