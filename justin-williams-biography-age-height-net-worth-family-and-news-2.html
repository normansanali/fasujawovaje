His favorite players growing up were Sergei Fedorov and Wayne Gretzky.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-williams-photo></span>Justin Williams Photo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was drafted in the sixth round, 125th overall, by the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)’s Plymouth Whalers in the 1998 OHL Priority Selection. He was signed as a 16-year-old by the Whalers and split time between the OHL club and their affiliate, the Compuware Jr. A. club of the North American Hockey League (NAHL), during the 1998–99 season. He finished his junior career with two seasons played for Plymouth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-williams-career></span>Justin Williams Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=professional></span>Professional<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=philadelphia-flyers></span>Philadelphia Flyers<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He was drafted in the first round, 28th overall, by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. In four seasons played with the Flyers, Williams struggled to live up to expectations, as he tried to adapt to the varying systems of three separate coaches – Craig Ramsay (2000), Bill Barber (2000–2002) and Ken Hitchcock (2002–2006). Williams was also frequently injured, which simultaneously hampered his development. He broke his left hand in his rookie season (hit by David Tanabe of the Carolina Hurricanes) and had various sprains and strains in his sophomore year.</p><p>He also suffered a left knee injury on January 18, 2003, when he was hit low by the Tampa Bay Lightning’s Brad Lukowich. The hit tore Williams’ anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL), and, on January 23, 2003, he had surgery to repair the ligaments. Originally projected to miss four to eight months recovering from the injury, Williams made it back into Philadelphia’s lineup in just three months.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolina-hurricanes></span>Carolina Hurricanes<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On January 20, 2004, Williams was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for defenceman Danny Markov. During the NHL lock-out in 2004–05, he went overseas to play for Luleå HF of the Swedish Elitserien, where he posted 14 goals and 18 assists in 49 games. Williams signed a one-year contract with the Hurricanes for the 2005–06 season when he set career highs in games played (82), goals (31), assists (45), points (76) and penalty minutes (60). In the 2006 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, Williams injured Montreal Canadiens captain Saku Koivu in the eye without being penalized in Game 3. Despite the severity of the injury caused by Williams’ high-stick, which severely threatened Koivu’s eyesight and forced him out of play for the remainder of the year, the NHL did not suspend Williams for his errant action, allowing him to continue participating in the playoffs.</p><p>Williams scored the final goal of the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, an empty net goal at 18:59 of the third period of Game 7. With the score 2–1, a loose puck along the boards ended up on the stick of Bret Hedican, who passed it to Eric Staal. Seeing Williams open, Staal threw the puck down the ice to him. Williams skated down the ice and tapped the puck into the open net, sealing the Hurricanes’ first Stanley Cup in franchise history. The Hurricanes won the series 4–3. On July 1, 2006, Williams signed a five-year contract extension with the Hurricanes worth $3.5 million per season. In 2006–07, Williams recorded career highs in goals (33), penalty minutes (73), power play goals (12) and game-winning goals (8). It was Williams’ second consecutive season of 82 games played. Williams made his first appearance in an NHL All-Star game at the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, recording a goal and an assist. Williams also played for Canada in the 2007 IIHF World Championship, in which he won his second gold medal.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-williams-net-worth></span>Justin Williams Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin Williams Earnings; How much is her Net Worth?

Friday, they picked up a free agent who might be able to finish a few more of the chances they generated last season in&nbsp;speedy winger Ryan Dzingel.</p><h5 class=h1>Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month</h5><p class=summary>Get full access to The News & Observer content across all your devices. It has been a mostly successful offseason for the Hurricanes, who have avoided pitfalls — Aho’s contract and the goalie situation — while addressing weaknesses with Haula&nbsp;and Dzingel.</p>But only mostly.<p>Their summer won’t be an unqualified success until they get an&nbsp;answer from Justin Williams, with the captain still deliberating whether to come back for another season or retire. The expectation within the team is that Williams will return, but no one but Williams really knows what he’ll do, and even he apparently doesn’t know yet. (He declined to comment via text message Friday.)</p><p>The Hurricanes need Williams back, perhaps less for what he does on the ice than what he does in the dressing room. The culture and atmosphere Williams and Rod Brind’Amour constructed from scratch last season is a fragile thing that needs tending and nurturing. Even in a reduced on-ice role at age 37, no one is better equipped to finish the job than Williams. His presence is absolutely vital for the Hurricanes to have a chance to continue their ascent, and Williams is more than capable of doing that in a reduced role.No one’s expecting him to continue to score 20-plus goals, and the addition of Haula and Dzingel would allow Williams to slot comfortably into a third-line role without as much pressure to produce as there was last season, especially in the playoffs. It all sets up nicely for him. If he comes back.</p><p>Otherwise, there’s a lot to like about what the Hurricanes have done, even if there are some inherent risks involved. Haula is coming off a significant knee injury, Dzingel is far from a perfect player but he can skate and shoot, they would have liked to upgrade from Mrazek but having him back is better than starting over and the Hurricanes had to ship out Calvin de Haan to make the finances work. But slam dunks (Victor Rask for Nino Niederreiter!) are rare in the NHL and the Hurricanes have done about as well to upgrade their roster as anyone would have imagined two months ago when their extended and prolonged season came to an abrupt end. The Hurricanes could probably still use a little more muscle in the wake of Micheal Ferland’s departure — not that he did much from the trading deadline on — but the Hurricanes believe they can cover the physical bases effectively enough with Staal and Jordan Martinook and Saku Maenalanen, especially if Andrei Svechnikov continues to grow into that part of the game.</p><p>There’s still the Brock McGinn arbitration case, but the additions at forwarding have lowered the stakes; McGinn, like Warren Foegele, are part of what is now a big group of players fighting for spots on the third line, and one of those will likely go to Martin Necas as the Hurricanes give him another shot, on the wing this time. And there’s the logjam at backup goalie with James Reimer and Anton Forsberg and Alex Nedeljkovic, but sorting that out is the definition of a first-world NHL problem. Reimer would probably be the best fit in the role vacated by Curtis McElhinney, but the combination of his hefty contract and Forsberg having to clear waivers injects some uncertainty into the equation. That’s all small stuff. The big stuff — sorting out the No. 1 goalie position, strengthening down the middle, adding a finisher — is almost complete. The Hurricanes have every right to feel good about that. But they won’t feel right about it until they get the right answer from their captain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKlqMGquoywoKWkmZa6tHnBoqagqpGltbp5wKCcZqCVnrSpwIynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMn5imoZyueqK6w2alnq%2BjYn9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
