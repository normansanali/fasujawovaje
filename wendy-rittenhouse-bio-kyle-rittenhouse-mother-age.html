I saw it. If I wasn’t his mother, I would have said the same thing – it was self-defense. He was chased by a bunch of mob,” she shared.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Wendy revealed that as Kyle returned home, she gave him two options — either turn himself in or leave town. Kyle chose the former one and the two drove down to the police station (at 1 am) where they asked for an attorney.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“With Kyle, I know him and he probably would do it again because that’s the type of person he is.
