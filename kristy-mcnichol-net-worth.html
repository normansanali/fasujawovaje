According to various sources, her net worth is estimated to be over $7 million, the majority of which she has accumulated through her acting career, spanning almost thirt years from the early 1970s.</p><h3>Kristy McNichol Net Worth $7 Million</h3><p>Kristy started her career by appearing in commercials with her brother. Later, she began starring in TV series such as “Love, American Style”, “The Bionic Woman” and others as a guest. In 1974, McNichol portrayed Patricia Apple in “Apple’s Way” and it was her first constant appearance on television. Her first significant role was Leticia “Buddy” Lawrence in TV series “Family” beginning in 1976and lasting four more years,even winning her two Emmy Awards for Best Supportive Actress.</p><p>Another important role was portraying Barbara Weston in the sitcom “Empty Nest” (“The Golden Girls” spin-off), starting acting in this TV series in 1988 but had to quit in 1992 because of the health problems. However, she returned to sitcom for its final series in 1995 and it was her last appearance on television. No doubt, Kristy can associate the major part of her net worth with her career in television industry.</p><p>However, Kristy played not only in sitcoms but also in movies. For example, she starred in the comedy “The End” in 1978, and two years later, in “Little Darlings”, co-starring with Cynthia Nixon, Matt Dillon and Tatum O’Neal. In 1981, McNichol played in “The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia” and earned an exceptionally large salary, especially for a 19 year-old. A list of other movies she starred in includes “You Can’t Hurry Love”, “Two Moon Junction” and “Only When I Laugh”, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Her net worth also benefited significantly.</p><p>Moreover, Kristy enjoyed some recognition as a singer when she and her brother Jimmy released the single “He’s So Fine”, which was very successful in 1978 and later recorded the album “Kristy & <a href=#>Jimmy McNichol</a>”. Also, Kristy performed a few musical numbers in special holiday episodes of “The Carpenters: a Christmas Portrait” and “The Carpenters at Christmas”. Additionally she lent her voice to the characters from animated series, like “Extreme Ghostbusters“ and “Invasion America“. All her works added steadily to her net worth.</p><p>Kristy finally decided to end her acting career in 2001, with her number of appearances totalling more than 25 TV productions and over 20 films. After retirement, she has been avoiding publicity and began to teach acting at a school in Los Angeles. More, she spends a lot of her time doing charity work.</p><p>In her personal life, Kristy came out of closet in 2012 and announced her non-traditional sexual orientation, hoping that it might help others who are bullied because of their sexual orientation. The actress was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (why she left the Empty Nest series). Currently, she’s living in Los Angeles and enjoys spending her spare time doing yoga and playing tennis.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=18.305660377358><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Kristy McNichol</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$7 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 11, 1962</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.6&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, singer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Jim McNichol, Carolyn McNichol Lucas</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Jimmy McNichol, Thomas McNichol, Jennifer Lucas</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Martie Allen</td></tr><tr readability=0.24615384615385><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/Kristy-McNichol-495024663860930/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0001531</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.26666666666667><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/kristy-mcnichol-mn0001179351</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Awards</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (1977, 1979), Young Artist Award (1982), People's Choice Award for Favorite Young Motion Picture Actress (1980)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Albums</td><td>“Kristy & Jimmy McNichol” (1978)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture (1982, 1979),Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress (1982)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Movies</td><td>Little darlings (1980), The Pirate Movie (1982), The Moon Junction (1988), “You Can't Hurry Love”, “Only When I Laugh”, “The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia” (1981)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>TV Shows</td><td>Family (1976–80), Empty Nest, Apple's Way (1974)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=14.905213270142><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Announced her retirement from acting in 2001.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Taught acting at a private school in Los Angeles.
