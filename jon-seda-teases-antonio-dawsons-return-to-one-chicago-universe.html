The actor said that people still recognize him as Antonio, even though he hasn’t been a part of the One Chicago universe since 2019."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was incredible, amazing cast.”</p><p>The actor said that people still recognize him as Antonio, even though he hasn’t been a part of the <a href=#>One Chicago universe</a> since 2019.</p><p>“That whole universe is incredible. It was so unique,” he recalled. “But it was so unique and to be a part of it from the beginning was really something special.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jon-Seda-Recalls-Incredible-Experience-on-Chicago-P.D.-Set-Talks-Final-Episodes-of-La-Brea1.jpg><p>Seda originated the role of Antonio Dawson as a <a href=#>Chicago Fire</a> guest star in 2012. He became a One Chicago regular two years later when Chicago P.D. premiered in 2014. Seda had a brief stint on Chicago Justice in 2017 before returning to Chicago P.D. until departing from the universe as a whole in 2019.</p><p>While there are no plans for Antonio to make his Chicago P.D. return, Seda hasn’t ruled it out entirely.</p><p>“Antonio didn’t die,” he told Us, playing coy. “He’s still alive.”</p><p>Now, however, Seda is focusing on the final season of NBC’s La Brea in which he’s played the role of Dr. Sam Velez since 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jon-Seda-Recalls-Incredible-Experience-on-Chicago-P.D.-Set-Talks-Final-Episodes-of-La-Brea3.jpg><p>“It is bittersweet. It’s such a fun show. I had a great time working on it,” Seda said of La Brea. “There’s not a lot of shows on TV where the families can come together and watch together. So, it has something for everyone.”</p><p>The actor noted he was “satisfied” upon reading <a href=#>the final season’s</a> scripts. There are only six episodes in the show’s third and last season — which premiered on January 9 — but Seda teased that the writers “did an incredible job” wrapping everything up for the viewers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jon-Seda-Recalls-Incredible-Experience-on-Chicago-P.D.-Set-Talks-Final-Episodes-of-La-Brea2.jpg><p>“There [are] a lot of unanswered questions that I know the fans want they want to have,” he said. “I think they’re going to be satisfied.”</p><p>As for what fans can expect to see? A lot of “creative” story lines.</p><p>“You’ll be surprised. This season is packed with a lot of stuff … there’s romance, there’s drama, babies,” Seda teased, noting that the show will focus primarily on trying to find <strong>Natalie Zea</strong>’s character Eve after she was “sucked through a portal” during the season 2 finale. “We’re trying to find her and there will be answers.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>New episodes of La Brea premiere on NBC Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>Reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGopl2osqWtjK2cmquVqHqiutOopaKnXZmuuL%2FOp6pmqpWpwrO6jK2mZqeemnqktMicmKCnXaq7qsLEq6qeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
