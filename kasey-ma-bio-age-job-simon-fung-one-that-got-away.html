She then let her followers know that she was very transparent about her past relationship with every guy she went on dates with.</span></p><p><span>Finally dropping the bomb, she added, “It’s too much for me now to commit to one guy after being in a 7.5-year relationship.”</span></p><p><span>Also, her FB relationship status, then, mentioned her to be “single.” All of which hints that Kasey was still searching for “the one.”</span></p><p><span>For those of you who missed her “search” on </span><i><span>The One That Got Away</span></i><span> here’s a recall for you. Stepping into the experiment following the end of 7 ½ years of exhausting relationship, Kasey met her first pursuer Dylan, her NYU study buddy, and she knew he was the one she’d she’d walk out with.</span></p><p><span>However, Simon’s arrival turned the tide!</span></p><p><span>Simon, another crush from her NYC days, appeared on the show, saying all the right things, and Kasey was more inclined towards him. Though the star and Dylan’s views on family definitely aligned, she preferred Simon for their every value (personal as well as professional) matched to a tee.</span></p><p><span>Coming from Chinese heritage, their desire for a partner to be optimistic, and their will to always stay career-oriented, it was like they were the same person. So, it was only obvious for Kasey to choose Simon and return to the real world with him.</span></p><p><span>However, unlike other contestants, she didn’t leave the show with a commitment. Rather, she asked Simon just to “take a shot at this,” and see where the roads took them. And Simon was more than happy to oblige as well.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>Besides sharing 7 ½ years of relationship with her ex, Kasey also shared two dogs and a car with him.</span></p><h3><b>Kasey Ma Age</b></h3><p><span>Kasey Ma was 30 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span>The One That Got Away</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>She does look a lot younger though.</span></p><h3><b>Kasey Ma Job</b></h3><p><span>Kasey Ma was working as a full-time Fashion/Lifestyle Blogger and Influencer at her company </span><i><span>TheStyleWright LLC </span></i><span>when she appeared on </span><i><span>The One That Got Away</span></i><span> in 2022.
