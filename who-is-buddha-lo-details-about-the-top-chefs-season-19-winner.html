Lo's winning menu included a hamachi starter, lobster laksa for the second course, Mongolian lamb entrée, and pumpkin mille-feuille and helped him beat Evelyn Garcia and Sarah Welch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lo won the Bravo cooking show thanks to his fastidious technique, attention to detail, and deep knowledge of Top Chef. He even studied the show to put together a winning formula. He had been a strong contender the entire season, which wasn't a surprise when he worked in one of Gordon Ramsay's three-Michelin-star restaurants and currently presides over a world-class caviar restaurant.</p><p>So who is Buddha Lo, and how did he do so well on the internationally renowned cooking competition?</p><h2 id=where-buddha-lo-was-born><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Where Buddha Lo Was Born</span></h2><p>Born to Chinese-Malaysian parents in Australia, Buddha Lo grew up in Port Douglas in far north Queensland. He earned the nickname Buddha as a kid because he was "eating too much of [his] dad's food."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He describes Port Douglas as a city closer to Papua New Guinea than it is to Sydney. He grew up foraging for edible ants and tasting dugong meat, the part of a handful of animals that only the local Indigenous Australians were able to legally hunt.</p><p>The chef learned to cook from his dad, who owned a Chinese restaurant in Port Douglas, Australia.</p><h2 id=how-buddha-lo-started-cooking><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>How Buddha Lo Started Cooking</span></h2><p>"I was babysat as a child, my parents worked seven days a week. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">And that was not sustainable," he has revealed when speaking about his childhood.</a> "At eight years old, I was like, I don’t want a babysitter. And I said to my mom,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Look, I’m going to do my own homework, I’m going to cook for myself, I’m going to prepare my own lunches. I’m going to look after myself.” So she ended up letting that happen. And so I started cooking for my brother, who’s older than me, making his lunch."</p><h2 id=buddha-lo-went-to-culinary-school-in-australia><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Buddha Lo Went To Culinary School In Australia</span></h2><p>Buddha Lo went to culinary school in Australia, only he didn't have to pay for it! He enrolled in courses at the renowned Melbourne William Angliss Institute. He continued to work while there alongside culinary school as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They realized that they have a skill shortage in cooks. So they decided instead of people having to pay to go to school, everyone gets paid to go to school. It’s a bit of a different system, but I think that one works because the culinary scene in Australia is amazing," the Top Chef winner explains. "And that’s because a lot of the cooks are able to go to culinary school. It’s not a high-paying job. It’s just like I don’t see anyone wanting to get into this industry and have that sort of student loan hanging over them and then getting paid probably close to nothing."</p><p>He also earned a scholarship to work for two months at the Chateau Cordeillan-Bages in France. This experience working in the <a href=# rel=noopener>2-Michelin star-rated</a> restaurant helped Lo on his path to Top Chef glory.</p><h2 id=buddha-lo-worked-for-gordon-ramsey><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Buddha Lo Worked For Gordon Ramsey</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After finishing culinary school, Buddha Lo moved to London to work at the three Michelin-starred restaurant Gordon Ramsay, where he met his mentor, Clare Smyth.</p><p>He later moved to New York City and spent a year at three Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park where he learned to push himself and work to a fine dining level.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Real Reason Why Gordon Ramsay Is Tougher On Hell’s Kitchen Than Master Chef">The Real Reason Why Gordon Ramsay Is Tougher On Hell’s Kitchen Than Master Chef</a></span></p><p>"So, when I got into the restaurant, I counted probably at least 20 people leaving in less than three months. Getting in is very easy. But surviving, that’s the hard part," he revealed about the experience.</p><h2 id=buddha-lo-39-s-father-died-days-before-top-chef><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Buddha Lo's Father Died Days Before Top Chef</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Buddha Lo's father, Tze-Kwong Lo, passed away from cancer just two days before Buddha got the phone call to find out that he had been chosen to compete on the 19th season of Top Chef.</p><p>Buddha and his dad were both huge Top Chef fans, and they always dreamed of him getting the opportunity to compete on the show. When he won the title, he said that it was both for him and for his father.</p><h2 id=where-buddha-lo-has-worked><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Where Buddha Lo Has Worked</span></h2><p>Buddha Lo has been a chef at so many of the best restaurants around the world. He’s worked for some of the most renowned Michelin-rated restaurants across the world, including New York City’s own Eleven Madison Park.</p><p>He’s worked in cities such as Paris, Copenhagen, and London, and in countries such as America, Australia, and Sweden.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-buddha-lo-met-his-wife><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Buddha Lo Met His Wife</span></h2><p>The technically trained Top Chef Season 19 winner was as known for being a family member as he is a fantastic chef.</p><p>Buddha met his wife, Australian-born Rebecca, in the kitchen about 10 years ago, when they both worked together at Hare and Grace in Melbourne, Australia. During a family meal challenge on the show, it was revealed Rebekah made a Pasta Amatriciana that was so good, Buddha declared on the spot that he would marry her if she was still single by the age of 30.</p><p>"It was just a joke, and I didn't mean to say it in a sort of creepy way, but it was that good. I was like, 'I could live like this forever...'" Buddha said on the Top Chef episode. "We call it Marry Me Pasta."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Top Chef star made good on his promise, and they wed in November 2018. Rebekah is the pastry sous chef at world-renowned Eleven Madison Park.</p><p>"Cook how you always cook," was her advice for him on the show. "She would remind me of my dad's favorite quote, which is 'If you think you can, you can.' That's what my dad always told me at the end of every phone call. She's taken that position now, and it was very encouraging. She was definitely instrumental to the win, for sure."</p><h2 id=what-buddha-lo-loved-about-top-chef><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Buddha Lo Loved About Top Chef</span></h2><p>Buddah Lo's favorite part of Top Chef was the challenges. He loves being able to cook with a fully stocked pantry with high-quality equipment that he didn't have to clean himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Gordon Ramsay Had To End This Popular Reality Show Because Of Lawsuits ">Gordon Ramsay Had To End This Popular Reality Show Because Of Lawsuits</a></span></p><p>"Definitely, the highlight was just the cooking itself. Obviously cooking for great judges. Even the main judges Padma, Tom, and Gail. I’ve been watching them for so long and just to be standing right there with my plate of food was amazing. And the low points, I think the living situation was quite low, but I understand why they do it," he revealed.</p><h2 id=what-buddha-lo-missed-most-while-on-top-chef><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>What Buddha Lo Missed Most While On Top Chef</span></h2><p>Buddha Lo wasn't too happy with the living situation on the show, but mainly he missed music. "Everything’s taken away from us, our phones, our TV, all that sort of stuff. I didn’t mind the phones and the TV, but I’m a person that loves music, so I always need music in the background."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You’re allowed to read, but you’re not allowed to read anything that’s cooking-related. And I’m kind of boring and I like to read everything that’s to do with cooking or watch things that’s to do with cooking."</p><h2 id=what-buddha-lo-will-do-with-his-top-chef-prize-money><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Buddha Lo Will Do With His Top Chef Prize Money</span></h2><p>"Believe it or not, even though it's been 200 days since I've actually won and that episode was filmed, I still don't know what I'm going to do with it yet," the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 19 star told Distractify about the $250,000 prize</a>. "It's going to be money that can make me live more comfortably. I've never had this sort of money."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Buddha Lo has never been money-orientated, "I sacrificed the money in order to work for really good chefs... I made those sacrifices for a very long time, and I had to really try and hustle my way through life," the chef revealed.</p><h2 id=buddha-lo-wants-to-open-his-own-restaurant><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Buddha Lo Wants To Open His Own Restaurant</span></h2><p>Buddha Lo’s not just satisfied with winning the competition, prize money and work for others. He wants to open his own restaurant. His post-Top Chef goal is to open a restaurant that one day earns him 3 Michelin stars.</p><p>But first, he wants to enjoy his win, go on vacation and relax for a little bit.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Who Is 'Top Chef' Winner Gabe Erales?">Who Is 'Top Chef' Winner Gabe Erales?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBurtSdm6GZXaG8brDErZiipKNirqO71K1kraCVYsGwvIycn56eo2LApq3SqKVmaWlixKq6zZ6paA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
