I’m also very much a tomboy in that role. So yeah, where there’s those dimensions and where it surprises people.”&nbsp;</p><p>Catch Jona Xiao as Rainbow Raider in new episodes of The Flash on Tuesdays at&nbsp;8 p.m. EST on the CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKuZmaOvsMOMq5iinJWnerC6jK2fnmWWoa60tA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
