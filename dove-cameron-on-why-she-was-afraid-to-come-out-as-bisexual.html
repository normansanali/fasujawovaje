The Liv and Maddie alum referenced her 2020 lyric video for “We Belong,” which featured line drawings of couples kissing. She specifically requested that the couples not all be heterosexual.</p><p>“When the song came out, everybody got the idea that the song was a big LGBTQ+ anthem song and I found myself in this position where everyone thought I was queerbaiting,” she recalled. “I went on Instagram Live and said, ‘Guys, I really needed to explain something to you. Maybe I haven’t said it, but I’m super queer. This is something I want to represent through my music because it’s who I am.'”</p><p>The “LazyBaby” songstress admitted that she had struggled for a while with the decision to reveal her sexuality, but hopes she can serve as an inspiration to <a href=#>fans who might be going through something similar</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dove-Cameron-Explains-Why-She-Was-Afraid-Reveal-Her-Bisexuality-002.jpg><p>“I hope it helps, that’s why I came out,” she explained. “It felt like something that I could never talk about. I feel like the industry has changed a lot in terms of having room for people with platforms to be human and not to be picked apart.”</p><p>Acting like everyone already knew, she continued, was only contributing to the problem. “I was really nervous to come out, and one day, I dropped it because I was behaving like somebody who was out and I realized I wasn’t,” she shared. “When you are who you are, you assume people see that and then you realize, ‘No, I have to come out, otherwise people aren’t gonna know.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In October, the Powerpuff Girls star revealed via Twitter that the twins she played on Liv and Maddie were <a href=#>part of the LGBTQ community</a>. “Maddie was definitely gay,” she wrote, adding in a second tweet, “Liv was bi.” She continued by telling followers that Mal, the daughter of Maleficent that <a href=#>she played in the Descendants trilogy</a>, was pansexual.</p><p>Cameron was previously in a relationship with her Descendants 2 costar <a href=#><strong>Thomas Doherty</strong></a>.
