What are you going to do about it?”</p><p>The <a href=#>Grammy winner</a> then screamed, “Oh my God! This is so cute!”</p><p>Perfect for the summer or a beach day, the <a href=#>Knit Slip Flare Leg Jumpsuit</a> retails for $84.95 at yitty.fabletics.com. With a VIP membership, shoppers can score the number for $30.58. Customers have praised the jumpsuit, which comes in four different colors, as “a PERFECT coverup.”</p><p>Lizzo <a href=#>Launched Yitty in March</a>, offering everything from outerwear to underwear in sizes XS to 6X.</p><p>“Instead of thinking about size in this linear way, we’re thinking about it on a spectrum where everyone is included,” the Michigan native said in a press release at the time. “Everyone’s size is just their size. It’s not high, it’s not low. It’s not big, it’s not small. It’s just your size.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued in the release: “I was tired of seeing this sad, restrictive <a href=#>shapewear</a> that literally no one wanted to wear. I had an epiphany like, ‘Who can actually do something about this?’ I decided to take on the challenge of allowing women to feel unapologetically good about themselves again.”</p><p><a href=#>Body positivity</a> is always on Lizzo’s mind. The musician got candid about her confidence journey in a December 2019 interview with <a href=#>CBS </a><a href=#>This Morning</a> after receiving backlash for wearing a <a href=#>thong-exposing outfit to a Lakers game</a>. “Do you know how long it took me to fall in love with this body? My butt was my least favorite thing about myself, and I learned to love it,” she said.</p><p>Offering her fans <a href=#>a bit of advice</a>, Lizzo added: “Be you, do you. Don’t ever let anybody take or steal your joy — especially not the internet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6G2u8bOZp2lmaOdsrR5x56pZqyYpLuoecinZKedp2LGqsDTsmSjrZ2lwLa102aumqyTnXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
