Recommended Videos The taboo-tackling series has shattered barriers and blazed trails across its four-season run, bowing out last week with a final run of episodes that may have ended up becoming too unwieldy for its own good, but still debuted as the single most-watched episodic offering at the streaming service’s disposal."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Where’s all my scenes? But like it actually makes sense for the season. It’s about other things. It’s about other journeys, not necessarily all about the intimacy. This season felt different from the previous ones. There’s a real maturity for the characters’ journey now. You can really feel the difference from Season 2 to where they are now. Enjoy seeing your favorite characters on screen one last time. Enjoy the stories that are told and for what Sex Education is all about, and take one fundamental lesson which is make sure you have consent and have open communication with your partner.”</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>There was far too much narrative heavy lifting to be done for Sex Education to spend an excessive amount of time in the bedroom – or wherever its raunchy roster of favorites tend to do their business – but it hardly sanded down its edges before bowing out, either.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypsdhmrqGdoprAbq3LpWStoJVixLC%2BymauoZ2imsBurculZKaxXaiwprrErGStoJVitq%2FAyKaYnLFdmLywvsOipZqsn6d6sLqMmmSrmaWjsKnFjKecrZ6cnsVussCvpquhpJp6qa3PqbBmrJ9iwKrAjKilZqyYmnq0tcOeo6Kmlah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
