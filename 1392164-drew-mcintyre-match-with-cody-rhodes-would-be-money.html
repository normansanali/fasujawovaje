Outside of the 2023 men’s Royal Rumble match, Drew McIntyre and Cody Rhodes haven’t shared the ring in years. Despite their distant paths this decade, McIntyre and Rhodes, of course, have ventured down parallel planes following their respective departures from WWE. After McIntyre was released from WWE in 2014, “The Scottish Warrior” returned to the independent circuit and later debuted for IMPACT Wrestling, where he eventually won the IMPACT World Heavyweight Championship."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Despite their distant paths this decade, McIntyre and Rhodes, of course, have ventured down parallel planes following their respective departures from WWE. After McIntyre was released from WWE in 2014, “The Scottish Warrior” returned to the independent circuit and later debuted for IMPACT Wrestling, where he eventually won the IMPACT World Heavyweight Championship. On the heels of his success outside of WWE, McIntyre finally returned to the company in 2017, later becoming a two-time WWE Champion.</p><p>Cody Rhodes experienced a similar experience as he molded himself into “The American Nightmare” in 2016. Following his notable runs in IMPACT, ROH, and NJPW, Rhodes helped lay the groundwork for a start-up promotion, now known as All Elite Wrestling. Like McIntyre, Rhodes eventually found his way back to WWE and set his sights on becoming WWE Champion.</p><h2 id=h-a-money-match>A ‘Money’ Match</h2><p>With their careers sharing a similar route, many WWE fans have been yearning to see a faceoff between the two. While it may not happen right now, Drew McIntyre is hopeful that the two will meet once again.</p><p>“We were the Tag Team Champions, we were both about 24. The Dashing Ones,” McIntyre told the <a href=#>Under The Ring</a> podcast. “A lot of people forget that but yeah, similar journeys. We got The Dashing Ones thing. There’s lots of other story elements and things that weren’t even on TV that can be touched upon. That’s a money story down the line and when the time is right. I don’t even wanna think about touching that until the time is right but, it’ll be a big deal when it happens.”</p><p>Rhodes is currently intertwined in a storyline with Brock Lesnar, whom he’ll be facing at WWE SummerSlam. Many fans and pundits were unsure of how Rhodes would recover from his loss at WrestleMania 39. According to McIntyre, Rhodes has bounced back quite beautifully.</p><p>“Cody’s journey really is incredible to watch,” McIntyre said. “And as annoyed as everybody was with WrestleMania and the finish, a large portion, I think people we’re seeing the bigger picture now. There’s so much more steam with the Roman-Bloodline story, but at the same time, WrestleMania was followed up with Brock Lesnar. Cody has just evolved and evolved and evolved. That’s what it’s all about, is the follow up and the follow ups and perfect. He’s done his role perfect and has just gotten more popular because of it.”</p><p><a href=#>Cody Rhodes Says He Left AEW Due To A Personal Issue</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJyaWpuZGKxs7HWZqScoZ6pxrOxjKaYrZuYYsSqwMdmmqicqWK%2FqbvDnqpmr5%2BquaV5wZ5kpqeemsY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
