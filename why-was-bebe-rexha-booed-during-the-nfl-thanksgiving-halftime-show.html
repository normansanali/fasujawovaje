Recommended Videos The game between the Detroit Lions and Buffalo Bills was tight and all NFL fans expected was some light relief with the halftime show. But when Rexha started performing a medley of some of her biggest hits, the crowd started audibly booing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But when Rexha started performing a medley of some of her biggest hits, the crowd started audibly booing.</p><p data-characters=583 data-current-count=823 data-injectable=true>While the crowd probably had many who weren’t into her music, the real reason she temporarily united her fans and the ones who swear by disliking her was the fact that the 33-year-old singer could barely be seen given the tight corner she was given for her performance. As she was hardly visible, most people in the stadium were forced to watch her on the Ford Field video screen. Half-time shows are usually done in midfield, but the strange decision to have Rexha perform on a tiny stage in one corner of the stadium left everyone more than a little annoyed with the arrangement.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>But apparently, the singer was aware of the less-than-comfortable set up in advance as earlier in the week Rexha tweeted “Yesssssss” in response to a fan asking her if she was nervous about the performance.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>Fans were treated to an audio-only rendition of “Hey Mama,” followed by her signature song “Meant To Be.” Then came the new hit “I’m Good,” based largely on Eiffel 65’s 1998 song “Blue (Da Ba Dee).” But the general disgruntlement with her barely visible performance remained. So, when the set finally ended, instead of applause, Rexha was treated to another chorus of boos.</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>Lions fans left the stadium even more dejected by the Bills’ 28-25 win. Needless to say, Rexha’s presence did little to lessen the sting of the loss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqcWMsJisZZKar6Z50Z6voZldl7ywscNmm66qmaO0bsDHnmSnnpxiwamtzaSqoKGmnruoeceao5%2BsmaKybr%2FHqK5o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
