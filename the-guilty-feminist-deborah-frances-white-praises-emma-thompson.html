We're all so busy that were so that we get into this role of responding and I think <strong>I don't want to be on my deathbed thinking I responded really well, I got back to everyone, I reacted. </strong>I want to be there thinking there are the connections I've made, this is what I created. We think of creating as screenplays and jars of jam, but it's also the connections we have made over the years.</p><p id=e8VrlUcCAkbd data-wc=2><strong>MORE IWD:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>12 fashion and beauty brands that give back to women for IWD</a></strong></p><p id=eYHJPghXEkCm data-wc=85>"I don't have children and sometimes doing something with a friend's child or children that <strong>I know I mean a lot to that child because they will remember that forever</strong> and it might be a small thing, but it will mean a lot to that child. It's formative, and where there are girls in my life who are not yet women, taking that time to find out who they are and what they might like to do I think can just be a wonderful thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/854c294b5a20-deborah-frances-white-on-stage-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eGQ-V3Wz8-Da data-wc=9><strong>The star is also an author and a screenwriter&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=egv7TllDAaGX data-wc=53>"So I think <strong>there's all sorts of ways of investing in our friends and their children</strong> and it's sometimes it can be half an hour, it can be five minutes.

Assume inclusion.</strong> Walk into rooms as if you're meant to be there and, notice start to be curious as to the way you physical eyes when you're with your closest friends, you see your friends in the pub and look at, look at how open your body language is. Look at how often you speak.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=ewf3gNBksJmK data-wc=14><strong>The star is currently amid a string of live shows with The Guilty Feminist</strong></p><p id=eXhHbr2v897A data-wc=101>"Look at how much you smile and then try and replicate those physical behaviours in a work environment. <strong>You send your brain a message if you're open, if you're smiling, if you're contributing,</strong> if you're leaning forward, if you're happy to listen to others and really listen to what they're saying rather than sitting there panicking, thinking I've got to say something, is what I'm saying clever enough? Which is something you don't sit there and think about when you're with your close friends, if you take on those behaviours, your brain gets the message, 'Oh, I'm happy and comfortable here.'</p><p id=eRenklrBisIr data-wc=38>"<strong>The other thing to do is to say, 'Okay, who's not speaking up in this meeting?</strong> Who haven't been heard from and include them?' And get that person talking because <strong>once you're the includer you will seem included."</strong></p><h2>How can people become good allies?</h2><p id=eOeDRe0T1nS3 data-wc=49>"Ask questions and listen, it's always useful to check in and see what support is needed but&nbsp;<strong>I would think support rather than help and ask questions and engage</strong>. Also see if that information is already out there as that person spoken about it before, is there stuff online?"</p><p id=eONBJ2W18ouP data-wc=55>"But the rule is to offer support and engagement rather than help.<strong> Can you support and is your support wanted or needed? </strong>And if it isn't, where could it be better directed rather than kind of slipping and going, 'Oh, I'll help here because it may be that that's not what I wanted or required.'"</p><p id=e8Gk2HKZbCnt data-wc=36>Deborah's<strong> first-ever play is playing at Chichester Festival Theatre in September</strong>.
