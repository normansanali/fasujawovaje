On top of that, I just feel like… I love Destiny so much, but I just feel like me and then the other two girls in the bottom four, we were all in strong couples and we were also all willing to experience other relationships outside of our couple, and I just had thought being in a couple was a big factor as to going home. So, I think the whole thing just confuses me.”</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>Harrison piggy-backed off of this statement, revealing who he thinks should have gone home on the men’s side:</p><p>“Maybe I feel like the way that Leo went about his move around from Kassy to Anna, then Anna to Kassy… I don’t know, that rubbed me up the wrong way, and he was the first to say that he went about it wrong, but I would think that that sort of to and fro is not, I guess not conducive to&nbsp;Love Island&nbsp;and heading in the direction of something serious with that person… Unfortunately, I just didn’t have a close enough connection with the other girls in the villa, so I was on the chopping block.”</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>Despite being dumped on the same night, at least Emily and Harrison got to leave as a couple, right?</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-to-emily-chavez-and-harrison-luna-after-leaving-the-villa data-injectable=false>What happened to Emily Chavez and Harrison Luna after leaving the villa?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Love Island Games (@loveislandusa)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Even though Emily and Harrison left the villa at the same time due to the decisions of their fellow islanders, fans of the franchise are wondering whether or not the duo has been keeping in touch after returning to their respective homes.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>With Emily living in Houston, Texas and Harrison living in Adelaide, Australia, it may be difficult to maintain a long distance relationship due to the extreme time difference, but fortunately, the two lovebirds did everything they could to make things work post-show.</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=140 data-injectable=false>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Collider</a>, Emily revealed the status of her and Harrison’s relationship shortly after leaving the villa:</p><p>“I’m waiting for him to come over here to the States. And he’s coming here soon, so hopefully we can work out a plan to see one another while he’s over here. As of right now, we’re keeping it pretty real with each other. He’s in Australia and we’ve known each other a week. We’re in communication and hoping to find some sort of plan to see each other when he does get here.”</p><p data-characters=62 data-current-count=62 data-injectable=false>To follow Emily’s optimistic statement, Harrison dished:</p><p>“I wouldn’t say it’s love just yet… it’s early stages, but you click with people for a reason. Who’s to say it won’t go in that direction? We’ve already spoken multiple times since we’ve been back, and we got to go out for dinner the night we left, and so it was really nice being able to leave with her. Although, unfortunately, I feel like I kind of cut her experience short a little bit. The reality of it is that I clicked with Emily better than I did with anyone else in the villa.”</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Despite having a game plan for the future, it is safe to say that Emily and Harrison are no longer together. Based on their respective Instagram accounts, it looks like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emily spends a great deal of time with islanders like Mike Stark</a>, and Harrison spends a great deal of time with islanders like Kassy Castillo and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnnie Garcia</a> instead.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, to take a trip down memory lane and relive Emily Chavez and Harrison Luna’s journey on&nbsp;Love Island: USA, you can stream the entirety of season 5 on Peacock now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yivsRmnKahnK56pLTAr5yzZZGjsW60wKupoqufo3qtwc2aZJ%2Bqn6J6tLHArKanZWVivKd5y6itnmWZqLmiusNmrKyZXajBqrjLZquon5Wptaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
