However, these actions have been observed to cause an increase in a player’s experience bar. Do note that the game counts the last hit for kills, which may be why you and your party members are leveling at different speeds, despite running the same dungeon together.</p><p data-injection=true><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The latest Dark and Darker patch has frustrated some with a heavy Wizard nerf</a></p><p>On that note, Experience Points from kills are not shared between party members, so ensure that you and your party are leveling up at a consistent pace. It also appears that Experience Points from monster kills are based on the type of enemy or perhaps even the difficulty of the floor, so players will gain more Experience Points from monsters further along the way.</p><p>Worried about the game’s difficulty? Do not fret — you will still gain Experience Points even if you are unsuccessful in your extraction. This prevents players from getting stuck in at level 1.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3f096d5b517256075b710433d777b5ab?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Glenn Lai</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Hey, I'm Glenn and I'm a freelance writer at Gamepur.
