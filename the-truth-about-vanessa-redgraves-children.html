"I'm just as fallible as the next person. I'm frightened that I will start living like them, always wanting to grab the moment for their account," Richardson said. She explained to the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> in 2019 that, during a holiday to Greece, she was "appalled" to see "everyone on their phone the whole time." "It was as if the sea didn't exist to swim in, just to take a selfie against and be Instagrammed. I was the only person who went in it."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The "Nip/Tuck" actor also revealed that she "felt slightly robbed" after a famous face (whom she did not name) took a selfie with her during a flight and then posted it to social media. "Another actress gave me a very effusive hello and said, 'Ooh, let's take a picture!' I couldn't work out what was going on but I knew something odd had just happened."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>While she's not accustomed to the world of social media, Richardson does use Google — even admitting to searching her late-father's birthday. "I googled him. And then I burst into tears, because there was something so mad about having to google your father." Aside from the death of her father back in 1991, and then her sister Natasha in 2009, the mother-of-one also had to deal with the possibility of losing two other family members due to heart attacks in 2015 — her mother (per <a href=#>The Guardian</a>) and her Italian brother, per the <a href=#>Daily Mail.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWphboF3e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2rrq%2Bx0qyYZqqVmbSzrdWeqmabmJ65pb7Ep2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
