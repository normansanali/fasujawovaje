Just ask Mickey Hargitay Jr., who has worked most of his life to remain grounded.&nbsp;Mickey Hargitay Jr. was born into a renowned family created by two Hollywood stars.</p><p>His childhood was far from average and by no means typical.&nbsp;However, that may have pushed Mickey to seek fulfillment by leading a relatively everyday life compared to his parents and some of his siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep reading to discover how Mickey Hargitay Jr. stayed grounded and what his life is like now.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mikley.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mickey_Hargitay_Jr_Acting_Career></span>Mickey Hargitay Jr. Acting&nbsp;Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born to two actors, Jayne Mansfield and Mickey Hargitay, it is unsurprising that Miklos Jeffrey Palmer Hargitay, aka Mickey Jr., also dabbled in acting.&nbsp;As an actor, Mickey Hargitay Jr., who was born on December 21, 1958 in Hollywood, California, USA, is best known for “New York, New York” (1967) and “The Merv Griffin Show” (1962).</p><p>He also featured in several other projects. However, his acting career did not extend past the 1960s.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Did_Mickey_Hargitay_Jr_Quit_Acting></span>Why Did Mickey Hargitay Jr. Quit Acting?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While many people yearn to be rich and famous, Mickey has been there and done that and has a greater affinity for stability and privacy.&nbsp;When the retired actor speaks about his childhood, he recalls how chaotic things were because of his parents’ fame.&nbsp;</p><p>Even as a child, he had developed an understanding — Hollywood was chaotic and “phony.” As such, he grew up craving stability and a connection to something real.&nbsp;</p><p>He once said: “[My family] made decisions to reach for the stars, and I’ve wanted to keep my feet on the ground. I’ve wanted to do something that seems more grounded and is more real.”</p><p>Mickey found that in plants. It started in his 20s when he would stroll the streets of Beverly Hills and Brentwood with macrame plant hangers draped over his shoulder.</p><p>He later opened a shop with his friends about the size of a living room on Echo Park Avenue called Max Macs, meaning maximum macrames. That little office became Mickey Jr.’s career; decades later, it has become a business he is content to manage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/miklos-820x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mickey_Hargitay_Jrs_Career></span>Mickey Hargitay Jr.’s Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mickey’s love of plants led him to start a business in gardening, and now his plant shop has remained a fixture in one of L.A.’s iconic communities for years.&nbsp;He has not only expanded the company but has also built a strong community around it. Some of his clients include Jim Carrey and George Clooney.&nbsp;</p><p>His love for plants began as a child. He once shared: “It was my chore when I was a kid growing up to water the plants. I didn’t know that was what I was going to end up doing. I probably hated it at the time, but you end up loving what you sometimes don’t as a child.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mickey used to collect cactuses and succulents, but something he couldn’t recall led him to macrame plant hangers.&nbsp;After leaving Echo Park, he opened a new business in an early 1900s bungalow on Fountain and North Sycamore avenues.</p><p>He was 23 then, and the plant shop doubled as his home, where he and his friends usually hung out and partied. Speaking about the early days, he said: “It was fun. It was great. We made a living but not a lot of goal setting or looking towards the future.”&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, Mickey got more serious with the business and started bringing exotic plants and educating clients on their care.&nbsp;As time passed, what used to be a house with plants for sale in the outside yard transformed into a haven for exotic plant species, indoor and outdoor flora, gardening materials, and a landscaping service.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mickey_Hargitay_Jr_Still_Touches_Lives_From_His_Modest_Perch></span>Mickey Hargitay Jr. Still Touches Lives From His Modest Perch<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Mickey Hargitay Jr. has given up any desire to be famous, his work still enriches lives.&nbsp;Many have praised his attention to detail, claiming that sets his business apart. He and his staff talk to customers, explaining how to tend to their plants so that they don’t need to return for another immediately.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/riska-fotor-20230825155713.jpg><p>One Eddie Jones, who’s lived across the street from Mickey Hargitay Jr.’s shop for over three decades, <a href=#>said</a>: “He’s got me into plants — having them and being able to take care of them.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jones also added. “It’s great for the community. He’s the type of guy where you’d want a business owner in your neighborhood. Just to see people in and out and buying plants.”</p><p>It is clear that while Mickey Hargitay Jr. may not be touching lives with movies and shows like his sister <a href=#>Mariska Hargitay</a>, he is doing his part and is having fun with it.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqqvyp6wZqCRp7SqwMCyZKOqXZ22tHnFmqSipKlisKm70p5kraddqLyivoybrK1lmJp6tMDAsqpmn6Kkwq%2BwxJ1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
