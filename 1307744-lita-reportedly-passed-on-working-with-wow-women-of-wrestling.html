A new report from Fightful Select reveals that WOW Women of Wrestling “made an overture” to WWE Hall of Famer Lita ahead of the announcement that the promotion would be returning to television in the fall of 2022. Talks did not progress beyond the overture as Lita quickly made it clear that she had no interest in working with Women Of Wrestling, specifically WOW’s David McClane."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Talks did not progress beyond the overture as Lita quickly made it clear that she had no interest in working with Women Of Wrestling, specifically WOW’s David McClane.</p><p>David McClane is the creator of GLOW Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling and WOW Women Of Wrestling, both of which became nationally syndicated series.&nbsp;As for the current direction of WOW, AJ Lee is attached to the project as a producer and color commentator. Tessa Blanchard was previously set to be a featured star, but she was said to be no longer associated as of May.</p><p>Earlier this year, Fightful reported that <a href=#>AEW had reached out to Lita</a> for a potential storyline involving Britt Baker. Those talks did not pan out either.</p><p>The former WWE Women’s Champion did, however, work two matches for WWE this year when she competed in the women’s Royal Rumble match and challenged Becky Lynch for the Raw Women’s Championship at Elimination Chamber in Saudi Arabia. Lita&nbsp;<a href=#>unsuccessfully challenged Becky Lynch</a>&nbsp;for the RAW Women’s Championship, and <a href=#>later told Corey Graves</a>&nbsp;that she was at peace if that was in fact her final match.</p><p>“I think the whole thing, it was so poetic and I felt like the fans had wanted that moment for so long,” said Lita. “And I didn’t realize that I wanted, needed or would feel a sense of satisfaction from having that moment, you know. I always maintained no I’m happy with my career, I’m satisfied, like you guys do your thing, girls. I just love watching the progress and watching you guys keep smashing glass ceilings. And I do believe that but I was like oh, like I won’t lie, that felt good and I did give me a sense of like peace having that as like that’s my last match, if that’s my last match, right? But it made me feel peace moving forward.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJpbnBsZGK5qsDAZqmeqJ%2Bnwaawy7JkqZmjqLKlec6nZLCnoqC2r7OMsKCtoF2svLh51qiknqZdpLNuw9Geqq2kmaO0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
