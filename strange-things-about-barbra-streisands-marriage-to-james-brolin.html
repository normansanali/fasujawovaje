"He charmed me when he was courting me ... He told me he could cook, and since I can't, I thought, 'Wow! This is a catch,' you know?" Streisand told the host. While she noted that Brolin won her over by making sushi, her favorite, she&nbsp;quipped, "He has never cooked again."</p><p>Still, as they say, the rest is history.&nbsp;"You're still holding hands," Vieira noted, to which Streisand said, "Yes, we are!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxgZ395e9KtqZqml5p6tbTIp56sZZGXvLbAjJuYq5qilnq0wNGeoKyZnpnAbrnAq6mimZeaerW7jKOYpp2jYq%2Bzu8uipWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
