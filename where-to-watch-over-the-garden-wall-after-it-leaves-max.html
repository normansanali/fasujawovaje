Beyond waiting for Cartoon Network to rerun the show on television, there are a few options to watch the show at your leisure. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">series star Elijah Wood pointed out</a>, Over the Garden Wall is still available to watch on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hulu</a>. The series is also available to buy on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Video</a>, and the prices are as follows:</p><ul data-current-count=840 data-injectable=true><li>Individual episodes in standard definition start at $1.99</li><li>Individual episodes in high definition are $2.99</li><li>The whole miniseries in standard definition is $6.99</li><li>The whole miniseries in high definition is $9.99</li></ul><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>It’s not guaranteed that the series will stay available online, though. In recent months, many <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">streamers have been offloading content from their servers</a>, often unpredictably. To circumvent this, you might want to consider buying the series on Blu-ray or DVD. Unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">neither format is available for purchase directly from Amazon</a>, but you can find a few third-party sellers online. Prices may vary.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is Over the Garden Wall about?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Over-the-Garden-Wall-Greg-and-Wirt-With-Pumpkins.jpg><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>Over the Garden Wall is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">horror-fantasy series</a> created by Patrick McHale. It follows moody teen Wirt (Wood), his younger brother, Greg (Collin Dean), a bluebird named Beatrice (Melanie Lynskey), and a frog as they venture through the Unknown, a strange forest resembling the New England countryside. Wirt and Greg can’t remember how they entered the Unknown and are trying to find their way home, only to be constantly waylaid by the bizarre and/or spooky denizens of the Unknown.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>Christopher Lloyd lends his voice to the Woodsman – a mysterious older man who keeps cropping up throughout Wirt and Greg’s journey, and Samuel Ramey delivers a memorable performance as the Beast – a folkloric, shadowy creature with sinister intentions.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is Over the Garden Wall appropriate for children?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Over-the-Garden-Wall-Possessed.jpg><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Over the Garden Wall is a family-friendly program, but parental discretion is advised. The series might be a bit intense for smaller children, with death and grief being heavily featured themes. That being said, the series’ intended audience probably hovers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhere around Coraline‘s level of maturity</a>.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=false>A child of about 10 to 12 years of age will probably be perfectly fine watching the show on their own, but younger children will likely need some guidance. It’s a fine <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halloween watch</a> and a great way to get kids into horror <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">without breaking out some of the gorier classics</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnGasn2LEosDCoWSorpWnerW0xGaemqqUmrtuw8Clo2aZlqmys3nIrWSlnZGrsrR5zJqvaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
