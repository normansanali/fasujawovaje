"The distance has been really tough on our relationship, because we haven't been able to see each other much.</p><p>"All relationships have their ups and downs, of course.

"Severe. It took every ounce of will to be able to do the Model 3 event and not look like the most depressed guy around.</p><p>"For most of that day, I was morbid.
