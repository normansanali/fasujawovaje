She was cast in Hook (1991) which was directed by her godfather, Steven Spielberg. She received many positive reviews and several awards for her acting. Later in 1995, she stunned the audience with her performance in Se7en as a young's wife detective and received another movie in 1996, which was Emma.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwyneth Paltrow And 14 Other Celebs Who Came Clean About The Roles They Regret</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the Iron Man actress first starred in Shakespeare in Love for her stunning performance which earned her an Oscar and a paycheck that could have been any celebrity's dream at the time; a whopping $750,000 US Dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After that, things just began to skyrocket for her when she was cast for many super-hit films such as The Talented Mr. Ripley, Contagion and of course, our very favorite the Avengers Franchise.</p><p>In 2000, Paltrow took to stage to show display her singing skills in the movie Duets which was directed by her father.

In 2008, as we all know, the first movie was a box-office hit and it earned over $585 million US Dollars worldwide; not to mention, worthwhile reviews and applauds from fans and celebrities alike.</p><p>One would think that she was satisfied with just being an actress at the time. But&nbsp;people were really surprised to find out&nbsp;that she had opened up her own lifestyle brand called <a href=#>Goop</a>. Paltrow began her journey by sending delicious recipes and wellness tips to her fans through newsletters to her email subscribers. Eventually though, Goop turned into an e-Commerce business and&nbsp;started to become a hit. Paltrow only earned $1.5 million in sales in 2012 but as of last year, Goop is estimated to be valued at over $250 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwyneth Paltrow's Selling A Candle That Smells Like Her...</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And just when we thought that that was it, there comes more.
