A wide variety of high schools have opened themselves up to film crews in the past, including Mar Vista Elementary School, Charles W. Eliot Middle School, John Burroughs Senior High School, Beverly Hills High School, and Beverly Vista Elementary School.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Because Los Angeles is such a natural hotspot for filming as the location of Hollywood itself, many other teen TV shows and films have used locations around the city as their setting.
