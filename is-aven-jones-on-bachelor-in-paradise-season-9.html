Recommended Videos Bachelorette alum Aven Jones is no stranger to drama. During his run on Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey’s season 19, he experienced a roller coaster of ups and downs, even going so far as to make it to the final two only to walk away empty-handed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During his run on Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey’s season 19, he experienced a roller coaster of ups and downs, even going so far as to make it to the final two only to walk away empty-handed. His lack of confidence in proposing to Rachel resulted in her breaking up with him, but this San Diego sales-rep-turned-social-media-influencer’s love story is far from over.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>The premiere of Bachelor in Paradise season 9 kicked things off with a fair amount of revelations and more than a few bouts of drama. Will and Olivia’s romance died before it began as Kylee swooped in and made his heart flutter like a butterfly. Then, in the last couple of minutes of the premiere, we saw Will break down in the trailer for episode 2 over what appeared to be Kylee’s infatuation with a new man… Any guesses who that new man might be?</p><h2 id=h-is-aven-jones-a-contestant-on-bachelor-in-paradise-season-9 data-injectable=false>Is Aven Jones a contestant on Bachelor in Paradise season 9?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>Aven Jones wasn’t advertised as a contestant on Bachelor in Paradise season 9 so when the contestants were informed he would be showing up at the Playa Escondida Resort late, jaws hit the floor. That’s right — Aven is back, and his presence has gone by anything but unnoticed.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Sneak peeks for season 9 show Oliva gunning for Aven’s attention, as well as Klyee, which is presumably the reason Will breaks down in tears. It’s anyone’s guess who Aven will end up with this time — if he does at all — but an early trailer for the season showed him sharing an intimate kiss with Kylee. “I’m very happy,” he said in between kisses. “Kylee, I haven’t felt like this in a while.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Aven-Jones.jpg><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true>Aven’s presence on season 9 was foreshadowed last year when he was asked to attend the Bachelor in Paradise season 8 reunion before ultimately being unable to attend. It’s worth noting that his former flame Rachel Recchia is also a contestant this season, so the drama could go from lukewarm to red-hot in a matter of seconds. In other words, you’re not going to want to miss it.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>Bachelor in Paradise season 9 aired its first episode on Thursday, Sept. 8.
