However, the crown jewel of the PPV might well be <a href=#>The Young Bucks</a> versus <a href=#>FTR</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Bucks and FTR have been building to this match for so long that <a href=#>AEW</a> didn't even exist when their rivalry began. The two teams have been taking jabs at each other for years, waiting for a time when all four of them were in the same company so that this match could finally happen.</p><p style=text-align:center><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>AEW Full Gear 2020: Match Card, Start Time, And Where To Watch</a></span></p><p>Now that weekend has arrived, and fans have been worried all week that the match might not happen. The final build to the angle has centered around FTR injuring <a href=#>Matt Jackson</a>'s leg. However, after trying to hurt him even more on <a href=#>Dynamite</a> this week, reports started to circulate that Jackson was legitimately injured. So much so that he might not make it to Full Gear and the Tag Team Title match would need to be postponed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It had even been suggested that Jackson suffered injuries to his MCL and ACL. Injuries of that ilk can keep wrestlers on the shelf for months. However, Jackson has put fans' minds at ease by revealing that the match will be going ahead. "I have indeed been medically cleared by my doctor to participate in Saturday’s match against The Bore Horsemen," Jackson tweeted.</p><p><strong>It's unclear at this point what exactly is going on. It's a possibility that Jackon isn't injured at all and this was all a work. A very convincing work too as both fans and news outlets have been fooled into thinking Jackon is really hurt. Or perhaps he is injured and it either isn't as bad as has been reported, or Jackson plans on powering through and taking a break after Full Gear.</strong></p><p style=text-align:center><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Miro Was Told His Feud With Bobby Lashley Would End In WrestleMania's Main Event</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeemsS0e8yaq61lmpawrL%2FOp2SbrZOgwG61zaOsq7Fdm8KtuIygnJqqXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
