Foley is famous for his hardcore style of wrestling and his willingness to put his body on the line in high-risk stunts. This often resulted in him being injured and bleeding during matches.</p><p>On a recent episode of&nbsp;<a href=#>“Foley Is Pod,”</a>&nbsp;Mick Foley hailed the chokeslam as one of the riskiest moves in the sport. Foley recalled a match in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he took a chokeslam from The Undertaker and suffered from internal bleeding.</p><p>Mick Foley noted that the chokeslam caused him to “spew blood everywhere” when he returned to the dressing room. This incident highlights the physical risks of professional wrestling and the potential for serious injury even from routine bumps.</p><p>“I remember wrestling The Undertaker in Fayetteville, North Carolina, just a regular chokeslam –- which was not the finish, we went a few minutes more –- but I can feel this internal bleeding coming up and I finished the last couple of minutes looking like Dizzy Gillespie on a hot trumpet solo, you know? My mouth was just full of internal blood. I made it back to the dressing room…went into the sink and just spewed blood everywhere, just from a simple chokeslam.”</p><p>“The chokeslam was difficult, because unlike say, a suplex, you are absorbing that impact from your shoulders all the way down your lower back, through the buttocks and your feet. A chokeslam, basically, you’re taking all the impact on a small section of your back –- especially in the old WWE rings before they changed them a few months after the [Hell in a Cell].”</p><p>“Just taking a chokeslam, if you land on one side or the other just slightly, you would feel it for a few days.”</p><p>Speaking of the risks involved with a chokeslam, Mick Foley’s Hell In A Cell match with The Undertaker is one of the most famous and dangerous matches in the history of professional wrestling. The brutal bout was part of the 1998 WWF King Of The Ring pay-per-view.</p><p>The match saw Mick Foley take several severe bumps, including being thrown off the top of the cage and through the roof of the cage, which resulted in him being covered in blood. Despite the dangers involved in his style of wrestling, Foley remains a beloved figure in the world of professional wrestling.</p><p>Less than two minutes into the Hell In A Cell match, The Undertaker threw Mankind from the top of the 16-foot high cell through the Spanish announcers’ table. The footage of that fall has since become one of the most-watched videos in professional wrestling history. A couple of minutes later, The Undertaker chokeslammed Mankind through the top of the cell, knocking him legitimately unconscious for a brief moment.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on the story?
