So far down, the earth is hot — volcanic activity in the region and a nearby fault line make sure of that.</p><p>From caves heavy with noxious carbon-dioxide gas, the hot water bubbles up through the cliffs overlooking the plains of southwest Turkey.</p><p>There, spectacularly displayed against the sky, it collects in a series of 17 terraced thermal pools, bringing the heat of the underground with it. Pools range in temperature from a pleasantly toasty 95 degrees to boiling.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-231175 alt="Thermal Pools" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pamukkale-thermal-pools.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-231175 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The terraced thermal pools at dawn.</span></p><p>But heat isn’t all the water carries with it from down below. It also contains a mixture of the minerals it is steeped in: bicarbonates, colloidal iron, and, most importantly, calcium carbonate.</p><p>It’s the latter that has forever changed the landscape. As heat and carbon dioxide rise from the steaming pools, the water leaves behind calcium carbonate deposits that harden first into gel and then into a strange, almost stringy-looking white stone called travertine.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-231174 alt="Pamukkale Thermal Pools" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cotton-cliffs.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-231174 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Pixabay</span><span class=caption-body>The travertine stalactites hang down the terraces of Pamukkale’s thermal pools like shreds of cotton.</span></p><p>Shimmering travertine covers every inch of the terraces, visible from the plains more than ten miles away.

She was rescued from her desperate attempt by a passing lord, who promptly married her and bore her off to a happily ever after.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-169055 alt="Pamukkale Turkey" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pamukkale-pools.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-169055 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The pools with the cotton-like formations of rock in the background.</span></p><p>Her tale harkens back to an ongoing mythology: to this day, many of the locals swear that the pools have curative properties and that bathing in them, even briefly, can do wonders for all kinds of ailments (though the science-minded remain skeptical).</p><p>But there is no story as strange as the one that played out 2,000 years ago, when the Galli, the eunuch priests of Hierapolis, discovered a mysterious cave below Pamukkale’s pools.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-231178 alt="Cotton Castle Cave" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pamukkale-cave.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-231178 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A gap in the travertine wall.</span></p><p>The grotto was dim, perpetually shrouded in fog so thick that it was almost impossible to make out the floor. And any animals that the priests brought into it grew weak and died on the spot.</p><p>The priests, having survived the trip into the cave, surmised that it must be the mouth of an entrance to the underworld and that they, as the gods’ representatives, had been granted divine protection.</p><p>It became a show: they would lead sacrificial bulls into the cave, which they named the Ploutonion after Pluto, the Greco-Roman god of the underworld. The big animals would inevitably fall, struck down, while the priests emerged unharmed to accept the cheers of the waiting crowd.</p><h2>The Mystery Of The Cotton Castle Is Solved</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-231212 alt=Ploutonion width=900 height=596 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pamukkale-ploutonion.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-231212 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Flickr / Carole Raddato</span><span class=caption-body>The entrance to the Ploutonion, thought to be the mouth of a gateway to the underworld.</span></p><p>The mystery of the Ploutonion has been largely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">solved by modern archeologists</a>, who, after watching several birds die in its entrance, realized that Pamukkale’s rich reserves of carbon dioxide were to blame.</p><p>The mist that haunted the cavern was indicative of a veritable wellspring: as the heavier gas, the carbon dioxide pooled near the floor of the cave, leaving a layer of oxygen above it.</p><p>The bulls the priests led into the cave — and the other small creatures the crowd was encouraged to pitch in as their own experiment — all had their heads lower to the ground than their human companions.</p><p>Cybele’s priests, however, weren’t quite as unaffected as they would have had the masses believe.
