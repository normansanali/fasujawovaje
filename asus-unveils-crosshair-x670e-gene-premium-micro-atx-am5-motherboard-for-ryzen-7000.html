Models like the Hero and the Formula are staples of ASUS's&nbsp;premium but popular ROG-themed offerings. One such series that was once the staple of ASUS's Intel models based on the micro-ATX form factor was the Gene, last seen in the days of Intel's 8th and 9th Gen Core series (2019). In what looks to be a resurrection of the Gene series&nbsp;for the&nbsp;release of AMD's Ryzen 7000 processors based on its latest 5nm&nbsp;Zen 4 microarchitecture, ASUS has announced that the Gene is back via the ROG Crosshair X670E Gene.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the years, the ROG Gene series has been synonymous with highly premium micro-ATX offerings, and it looks as though the ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Gene is no different this time. Some of the ROG Crosshair X670E Gene's main features include a full-length PCIe 5.0 x16 slot, one PCIe 4.0 x1 slot, and&nbsp;<span>a single PCIe 4.0 x4 M.2 slot.&nbsp;</span>ASUS includes another&nbsp;expansion slot next to the two DDR5 memory slots for an included ROG Gen-Z.2 M.2 add-in card with support for&nbsp;up to two PCIe 5.0 x4 M.2 drives.</p><p>The ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Gene will also feature a 16+2 phase power delivery with premium 110 A power stages, an Intel-based 2.5 GbE, and Wi-Fi 6E networking pairing, as well as support for USB 3.2 G2x2 with Quick Charge 4+ (60 W) capability. ASUS also states that it will also have rear panel USB4 support, although ASUS hasn't provided full specifications to us at this time.</p><p>At the time of writing, ASUS hasn't revealed much for the ROG Crosshair X670E Gene, nor how much it is expected to cost or when it might hit retail shelves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH54gZNpZpqrpah6trrVnqClq12Yv7C%2F0qGYoqpdrYN4fMRmnp6mlWK9s7HMoqymZZ2esLO7jJqrsWWRooJuuc6tn56qkqSus7CMn6arZaKux6a6jHBnaWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
