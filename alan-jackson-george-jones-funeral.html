This is to give respect, to remember, and to commemorate “The Possum,”&nbsp;as one of the greatest country legends of all time.

All of them were emotional as they dedicate their songs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span style=color:#000><strong>Alan Jackson’s “He Stopped Loving Her Today”…</strong></span></h2><p>It can be seen in the video how Jackson gave justice to the song. We all know, “He Stopped Loving Her Today” is a sad and a trademark of Jones. But Jackson gave integrity as there are no other country artists more qualified to sing the said song.</p><p>Furthermore, the video shows how Jackson hides and fights back his sentiment. Tears might not have fallen on his cheeks, but the emotion can be perceived in his eyes which he tried to conceal while performing. At the end of the video, Jackson almost lost&nbsp;it. This only means that he’s been holding his empathy towards the death of his dear friend. Jackson and Jones are great friends, they are, indeed, brothers by heart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span style=color:#000><strong>George Jones…</strong></span></h2><p><strong>George Glenn Jones</strong> was born in Texas on September 12, 1931. He achieved international fame for his long list of hit and No.1 records, including his best-known song “He Stopped Loving Her Today.” Jones was also known for his distinctive voice and phrasing. In the course of his life and career, Jones was recurrently referred to as the most significant living country singer.</p><p>Without a doubt, George Jones touched us in so many ways. He moved and influenced people especially the country music enthusiasts. Specifically, Jones with his song “He Stopped Loving Her Today” made the world cry. With its thoughts and melody, it is indeed a lonely song. And still can make your eyes water.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span style=color:#000><strong>George Jones’ Death…</strong></span></h2><p>George Jones passed away on <strong>April 26, 2013, at the age of 81 from hypoxic respiratory failure</strong>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursaSdrq%2Bzw5qgpbFemLyue8ClmKdlmpawrL%2FOp2SgnZ%2BntKZ5yailnqtdm8KvsdGao2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
