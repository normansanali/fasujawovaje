And now, with Season 3, the creators of the show are all set to amp it up a notch with the addition of the agents of mayhem, i.e., <a href=#>the Sisterhood of Dada</a> and the Dead Boy Detective Agency from <a href=#>the Sandman comics</a>, who will be played by five new recurring actors and three guest stars.&nbsp;</p><p>As reported by <a href=#>Deadline</a>, actors Micah Joe Parker, Wynn Everett, Miles Mussenden, Anita Kalathara, and Gina Hiraizumi will be joining the Season 3 cast of <a href=#>HBO Max</a>’s Doom Patrol as recurring characters representing the Sisterhood of Dada while Madalyn Horcher, Ty Tennant, and Sebastian Croft will be appearing as guest stars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/micah-parker-e1619286785646-900x461.png><p>Parker, who is better known for his one-time cameo in the CW’s <a href=#>The Flash</a> and as Adrian in The Vampire Diaries. In Doom Patrol he will be playing the role of Malcolm, who is perhaps the most reserved of the five members of the Sisterhood of Dada. As per his character description, “he is a quiet, sensitive and thoughtful soul” who detests the diplomatic, unforgiving world and prefers to be invisible instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Agent Carter actor Wynn Everett will be seen in Doom Patrol as the second member of the organization, Shelley Byron aka The Fog, and is described as a deadly terrorist who is a more dangerous adversary because of her misleading charming, seductive, and poetic personality. According to the comics, she has the ability to turn himself into a psychedelic death cloud that can gobble up people in no time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Mussenden, who has starred in The Swagger and Marvel’s Cloak & Dagger, will be seen as cryptic and rather eccentric sculptor Lloyd Jefferson aka Frenzy, who is also a part of the Sisterhood of Dada in Doom Patrol. You will peg him as strange and scary at first sight- he is covered in tattoos and scars, a reminder of the traumas he has endured in his life. In comics, the character can turn into a living cyclone.&nbsp;</p><p>Room 104’s Anita Kalathara will play the fourth member of the sisterhood, Holly McKenzie aka Sleepwalk. While she is all for fun and partying all night, if someone wakes her up from one of her naps, then she is not so nice anymore. In the comics, she has super strength but only when she is asleep. How will that be shown in the series is something only Season 3 can tell us.</p><p>The recurring character of Sachiko aka The Quiz, a part of the Sisterhood of Dada, will be played by Dynasty’s Gina Hiraizumi who is cursed with her phobia against germs and blessed with a plethora of super-cool powers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As for the three guest stars in Doom Patrol, <a href=#>The Direct</a> reports that Ty Tennant and Sebastian Croft will make up the Dead Boy Detective Agency from the Sandman comics. Tenant will be the ghost of Edwin Payne while Sebastian Croft is Charles Rowland, two long-dead lads who stayed behind as ghosts but are still haunted by how they died. We also have Madalyn Horcher as the guest character of Crystal Palace, who is described as a teenage medium whose tendency to be super sarcastic has only left her with two friends, Charles and Edwin.</p><p>The rest of the cast of Doom Patrol includes Diane Guerrero as Crazy Jane, April Bowlby as Rita Farr aka Elasti-Woman, Matt Bomer as Larry Trainor a.k.a. Negative Man, Brendan Fraser as Cliff Steele aka Robotman, Joivan Wade as Victor Stone aka Cyborg, and Timothy Dalton as The Chief.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2icn6S6brzAramopF2YrrTAjaGrpqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
