Yesterday <a href=#>we detailed the announcement of the LG G3 Stylus</a>, and today LG is giving a sneak peak at its first smartwatch with a round face. It's called the LG G Watch R, and as you may have guessed, the R stands for round.&nbsp;</p><p>At its core, the G Watch R is basically the same device as the original G Watch. It uses Qualcomm's APQ8026 quad Cortex-A7 part running at 1.2GHz, paired with an Adreno 305 and 512MB of RAM plus 4GB of NAND. It also retains the G Watch's IP67 rating for submersion in water up to 1 meter deep for 30 minutes. The battery receives a small 10mAh bump from 400mAh to 410mAh. A heart rate monitor has been added, taking away one of Samsung's points of differentiation with their Gear Live smartwatch.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/8438/1_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><span>The real changes come with the display and the build. The original G Watch has a square display. The G Watch R sports a 1.3" plastic OLED (P-OLED) display with a 320x320 resolution (which likely means the vertical and horizontal resolution at the watch's widest points in those directions) that takes up 100% of the watch face. This contrasts with the yet to be released Moto 360 which has a 1.5" rounded display but has a segment at the bottom which isn't part of the usable display area. The display is surrounded by a stainless steel bezel and frame, and comes with a leather strap.</span></p><p>The G Watch R is the first smartwatch I've seen that really looks like a traditional analog watch. The Moto 360 is definitely up there with it, but for me the gap in the display on the Moto 360 takes away from it significantly.</p><p>LG says that the G Watch R will be available in Q4 of this year. There's no word on pricing but it'll likely be higher than the standard G Watch which currently sells for $229. More details about the G Watch R will be revealed soon at IFA Berlin.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>LG</a> via <a href=#>Android Police</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIV1f5doo6BlkaO7sMHNnJysZaSdsm6zjLCYrZuYYr8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
