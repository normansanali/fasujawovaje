Bies was outraged when investigators raided former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.&nbsp;Adam Bies attacked the FBI and law enforcement in a social media post, writing:</p><p>“My sole objective is to murder as many of them as I can before I die…”</p><p>According to another post:</p><p>“You Deserve To Die If You Work For The FBI.”</p><p>Adam Bies, 46, of Mercer, Pennsylvania, has been charged with one count of influencing, hindering, or retaliating against federal law enforcement personnel. If convicted, he faces at least ten years in prison. The FBI’s domestic terrorism surveillance organization highlighted postings from his account “BlankFocus,” according to a criminal complaint filed in his case.</p><p>One of his several aggressive postings stated:</p><p>“Every single jerk who works for the FBI, from the director down to the janitor who cleans their f—ing toilets, ought to be killed. You’ve declared war on us, and it’s now all guns blazing.”</p><h2>Adam Bies would go on a rampage about mask requirements and coronavirus vaccines.</h2><p>Adam Bies has compared the FBI to the Nazi SS and the Soviet-era KGB. He expressed his ideas on Gab, a microblogging and social networking site popular among far-right extremists.&nbsp;His professional website, as a self-described photographer, emphasized his dissatisfaction with the forces altering the American economy. Gab subscribes to the QAnon conspiracy theory and does not regulate its material as strictly. Several opponents have spoken out against the platform, claiming it might incite violence.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Adam-Bies-2.jpg alt="Adam Bies" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the arrest document, Gab provided federal officials with information on Adam Bies’ private chats and posting history in response to an emergency disclosure request.&nbsp;Federal authorities are concerned about an increase in right-wing violence, particularly in Pennsylvania. According to reports, around 70 extreme organizations took part in the violence at the US Capitol Building on January 6, 2021.</p><p>Bies’ writings have been labeled as “unprecedented” by officials, pointing to the amount of violence and his demands for “civil war” or “armed insurrection.”&nbsp;In light of the threats against law enforcement on social media, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security presented a joint intelligence briefing last week. This was in reaction to a “dirty bomb” put outside the FBI’s Washington offices.&nbsp;A Pennsylvania man named Ricky Shiffer, 42, attempted to enter the FBI facility in Cincinnati with a nail gun and an AR-15-style weapon in one such incident. He was slain, though, after a confrontation with officials.</p><p>Adam Bies wrote hours after Shiffer’s death:</p><p>“I already know I’m going to die at the hands of these scumbag cops. My sole purpose is to murder as many of them as possible before I die.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Adam-Bies-mar-a-lago-1.jpg alt="Adam Bies mar-a-lago" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He continued:</p><p>“I refuse to spend a single second of my life in their captivity.”</p><p>According to an official news release, the prosecutor, in this case, will be Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Bengel. Meanwhile, the case is being investigated by the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, the North Country Violent Offender Task Force, Pennsylvania State Police, and the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Adam Bies</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Donald Trump</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYnZmdYq%2BqsdJmrpqrXZa%2Fs7HSrZydZZakv27Ax6ucmqyVo7avs4ytpmajmaG5brLBomSonpaesKa%2B0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
