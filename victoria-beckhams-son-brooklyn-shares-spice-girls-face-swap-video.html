Victoria Beckham’s 22-year-old son, Brooklyn Beckham, followed his mom’s singing footsteps in a hilarious Face Swap video.
“Oh gosh @victoriabeckham,” the model captioned his Monday, March 22, Instagram Story, which plastered his face on each member of the Spice Girls in the 1996 “Say You’ll Be There” music video.
The photographer mouthed the words to the song and smiled as he bounced from Baby Spice to Scary Spice, Sporty Spice, Ginger Spice — and his mom, Posh Spice."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You know, we’ve watched the movie together, and when I was on tour with the Spice Girls [in 2007], I took the children with me. So they were with us, yeah.”</p><p>Cruz takes the most after his mom. “He’s so musical. And I didn’t even realize that he could sing,” Victoria explained. “He’s always the one that plays football, and he was just sitting in the back of the car one day and he was singing, and I was like, ‘Wow, you can really sing.’ … We are like a traveling circus, our family. We sing, we dance, we do football, we do fashion!”</p><p>As for Harper, she can “run in high heels,” which makes her mom “so proud.” Victoria added, “It was so great to have a girl. The boys are so great with her, and David’s such a great dad. It’s so cute to see him with a little girl. She’s so great and she’s a little tomboy playing in the garden with her brothers playing football, and David as well, but she’s also very girlie. So she loves to play with makeup.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGavoZOpvLO1wGaZnpubna6uv4yspqdlkqe8sLfLsqVmq5iWv6a%2FjKynopuVYrSqvsusZJ%2BZk5p6tMPAqWSvoZSavHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
