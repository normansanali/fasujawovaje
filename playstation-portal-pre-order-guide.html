We're seeing some semi-regular PlayStation Portal restocks in early 2024 with multiple retailers continuing occasional restock through February. It's often fleeting still, but it feels like it's getting more regular. For the first time in a while now, we've actually seen stock hold for more than a day at two retailers in the UK, for example. Hopefully, this is a sign of things to come."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's often fleeting still, but it feels like it's getting more regular. For the first time in a while now, we've actually seen stock hold for more than a day at two retailers in the UK, for example. Hopefully, this is a sign of things to come.</p><p>With the launch of the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5/playstation-pulse-explore>PlayStation Pulse Explore</a> earbuds and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5/playstation-pulse-elite>PlayStation Pulse Elite</a> headset, we're hoping <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/tag/sony>Sony</a> is ramping up production of the Portal behind the scenes to increase the frequency and availability.</p><p>The lack of stock is giving us terrible flashbacks of 2020 and 2021 during the great PlayStation 5 stock shortages when the console first launched. But we're here to help, keeping an eye on the PlayStation Portal restock situation and updating our PS Portal stock tracker regularly.</p><p>We're always big advocates for persistence and patience, as it can often be rewarded (especially if you add a dash of luck), so we recommend sticking with trusted retailers like those on this page, and keep trying as you may well get lucky - and never pay the scalpers' prices!&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder of why we love the Portal, we think that it could be, for many folks, a revolutionary device, opening up extra gaming opportunities and time. It's proved so with me and I can't put it down - read more in our full <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/gaming/playstation-portal-review>PlayStation Portal review</a>.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-where-to-buy-playstation-portal-us><span>Where to buy PlayStation Portal - US</span></h2><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-where-to-buy-playstation-portal-uk><span>Where to buy PlayStation Portal - UK</span></h2><p>We'll do our best to keep the page updated to direct you to the best places to try as stock levels change. If you're still on the fence and need some more focused help working out whether the device is for you, then check out our guide to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5/should-you-buy-a-playstation-portal>should you buy a PlayStation Portal</a>, as well as our <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/ps5/playstation-portal-vs-backbone-one>PlayStation Portal vs Backbone One</a> comparison.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-playstation-portal-alternatives><span>PlayStation Portal alternatives</span></h3><p>If you're really keen to pick up a remote play device or a handheld games console like the PlayStation Portal, but need something soon, as a gift for the holidays, or want to bypass the limbo of there being no stock, then we've got the latest, lowest prices below on some fine alternatives.&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Get the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.</p><p>Remember though that none of these alternatives will do exactly what the PlayStation Portal offers - streaming PS5 games over the internet from your PS5 to a dedicated handheld device. You can recreate this in principle with the BackBone One controller and your mobile phone, but it's worth reiterating that the below aren't like-for-like replacements.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-where-to-buy-playstation-portal-tips-and-tricks><span>Where to buy PlayStation Portal - Tips and tricks</span></h3><p>I've been keeping an eye on PlayStation Portal restocks since the handheld launched, and also throughout a portion of its pre-order phase too. I've also embedded myself in the Portal community online from regional Facebook groups to the official subreddit channel to immerse myself in all things PS Portal - be it restocks or folks asking for network and internet tips.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, I've seen every single stock drop happen since mid-November, and have picked up some tips and tricks that might help you get to the front of the queue when stock becomes available, or at least give you the best chance in advance.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-where-to-buy-playstation-portal-faqs><span>Where to buy PlayStation Portal - FAQs</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg><h3>Is the PlayStation Portal sold out?</h3><p>As it stands at around 9am ET on March 20, the PlayStation Portal is out of stock at all major retailers in the US, but is available at Very and PlayStation Direct in the UK!</p><h3>How much does the PlayStation Portal remote player cost?</h3><p>The PlayStation Portal remote player costs $199.99 in the US and £199.99 in the UK. Variations in price will be found across different regions as stock becomes more widely available and rolled out.</p><h2 id=can-you-use-the-playstation-portal-away-from-home-3>Can you use the PlayStation Portal away from home?</h2><p>Yes! While Sony has largely pushed the PlayStation Portal as a device to use on the same Wi-Fi network as your PS5, if you have a strong enough internet connection (be it Wi-Fi or 5G) then you will be able to use it away from home. I tested this for our review and have consistently used it on 5G - the connection takes a little longer to 'talk' to your PS5 but it works!</p><h2 id=when-will-playstation-portal-stock-return-3>When will PlayStation Portal stock return?</h2><p>It feels a bit like reliving the PS5 stock shortage all over again - we are relying on flashes of stocks without any real official word. The grains of hope we can cling to right now are the consistent restocks at the likes of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/tag/amazon>Amazon</a>, Best Buy, and Walmart which might get flashes of inventory.</p><h2 id=do-you-need-a-ps5-to-use-a-playstation-portal-3>Do you need a PS5 to use a PlayStation Portal?</h2><p>Yes, you absolutely need a PS5 to use a PlayStation Portal. The Portal is exactly that: a window into and a means of mirroring your PS5 so it can only be used in tandem with a PlayStation 5 console.</p><p><strong>If you've got a unit and are looking for game recommendations then check out our guide to the </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/gaming/best-playstation-portal-games><strong>best PlayStation Portal games</strong></a><strong> </strong><strong>and remember, you might want one of the </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/news/best-wired-gaming-headsets-2021-plug-and-play><strong>best wired gaming headsets</strong></a><strong> or a wired </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/news/best-ps5-headsets><strong>PS5 headset</strong></a><strong> to team with your Portal too.</strong><strong> If you're on the hunt for </strong><strong>other portables, however, then, head over to our guide to the </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/best/best-handheld-games-consoles><strong>best handheld game consoles</strong></a><strong> you can get right now.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHCoamanJGne6S7zGiemqWZo7RwvMuasKyskam2sLqMqaarrJGherG%2BxGamq5yVp3qowcidnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
