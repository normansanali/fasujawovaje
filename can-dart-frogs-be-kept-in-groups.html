Males wrestle over territories, exhibiting similar grasping behaviors (amplexus) for mating in other frogs, and females do the same over the best egg-laying sites. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on saczoo.org</a><h2>Do dart frogs need to be in pairs?</h2>Semi-arboreal species prefer a combination. For some species of dart frog, multiple frogs may be housed together. However, aggression may occur in any species of poison dart frog and is very common in some species. Reduce aggression by separating into sexed pairs. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on azeah.com</a><h2>Can You Keep Different Dart Frog Species Together?</h2><h2>Can I keep 4 dart frogs together?</h2>Certain species of poison dart frogs (Dendrobatids) have been kept together successfully by some hobbyists.
