Stause spoke about her bond with Savchenko after the news flashed. She stated;</span></p><p><span><strong>"He is the absolute best. I absolutely love him. He is so patient and he's just ... he knows how to push me, but not in a way that's intimidating, and I think that that is a little bit what I was scared of working with a pro. I just felt there's a lot of intimidation there with feeling like they're going to be disappointed when they find out they were paired with you because there are some people that are already so talented."</strong></span></p><p><span>Elena Samodanova and Gleb Savchenko were married back on 13 July 2006 in Moscow, Russia. They have welcomed a couple of kids, namely,&nbsp;Olivia and Zlata, together in nearly one and a half-decade long married life.
