This helps to keep the slimy nature of the okro throughout the cooking process.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqKloKqVmbamutOsZJ%2BnomK8rL7OZqqtnadirq%2BwjKGmsGWkpHqxvsSpmKudXZ7Bbr%2FLoqSyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
