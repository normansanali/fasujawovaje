The unexpected loss of her father last year fueled her ‘Idol’ journey, she said. Kinstler has a powerful voice that’s won her praise from all of the judges. “Your voice quality, your confidence, the way you portray yourself on stage, it’s a winning package,” Lionel Richie said.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Chayce Beckham</a>, 24, hails from Apple Valley, California. His mom and stepfather signed him up for American Idol after a horrible accident last year that changed his life. After his audition, Katy Perry predicted he would be top 5. The country rocker’s first single “23” hit number one on two iTunes charts after its release last week.</p><p>Willie Spence grew up in Douglas, Georgia and started singing at his grandfather’s church in Florida at age 6. Now 21, Spence shared some of his struggles with health over the last year. He’s lost over 180 pounds since being hospitalized in March 2020. Spence has a booming voice that’s earned him standing ovations from the judges this season. Luke Bryan told him, “You just have the magic, buddy.”</p><p><b>LIVE IDOL ENCORE</b><br>After the new ‘Idol’ is crowned, fans can play a part in bringing back a favorite finalist for an additional national TV appearance: a special encore performance on <a href=# rel=noopener>“Live with Kelly and Ryan” via “Live’s ‘American Idol’ Encore.”</a> Tune in Monday morning!
