The truTV series kicks off with Michael usually pretending to be a retail employee, while the final, longer act is more elaborate and requires more planning.&nbsp;</p><p>To accomplish this, Michael and his team use six cameras to capture all the action, and simple tricks like footprint decals to subconsciously encourage people into the right position. And yes, it usually requires more than one take.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>"We really don’t know how it’s going to play out," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Blurred</a>.

"As a magician, it’s like a reverse pick-pocket," he explained before adding, "I really do a good job. I’ve never taken somebody so far they were terribly upset. Maybe I’m like that sarcastic person — I get away with it."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Michael Carbonaro married?&nbsp;</h2><p>Now, the more important question: is Michael single?
