Reach out to us here, include in your message that you need to update your <b>age</b>, and let us know your correct date of birth.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-change-your-age></span>Can you change your age?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>You can</b>‘t <b>change your age</b>, it changes all by itself.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-age-range-is-bumble-for></span>What age range is Bumble for?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>According to April 2020 survey data of adults in the United States, 10 percent of respondents aged 30 to 44 years were currently using <b>Bumble</b>. Adults aged 18 to 29 years were most likely to use the social dating app, as 13 percent of respondents from that <b>age group</b> confirmed being current users.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-50-year-olds-use-bumble></span>Do 50 year olds use Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Is <b>Bumble</b> for over <b>50 year olds</b>? Well, the simple answer is that <b>Bumble</b> is for everyone. So, yes, <b>Bumble</b> is for over <b>50 year olds</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-i-get-tinder-or-bumble></span>Should I get tinder or Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Tinder</b> is the fun, easy-to-<b>use</b> dating app if you want to <b>have</b> a good time… right now. <b>Bumble</b> is the dating app for women who want to be empowered, and men who want to let women <b>make</b> the first move. The more people feel comfortable dating online, the more chances there are for people to <b>find</b> love.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-tinder-so-hard-for-guys></span>Why is tinder so hard for guys?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The reason <b>men</b> have it <b>harder</b> is because supply and demand. There are a lot more <b>men</b> on the app than women. Also like many people have said women can be a lot pickier.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-bumble-a-hookup-app></span>Is Bumble a hookup app?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Bumble</b> is not a <b>hookup app</b>. According to <b>Bumble</b>, less than 4% of men and 1% of women are looking for a <b>hookup</b> on <b>Bumble</b>. The mobile dating <b>app</b> is used to find meaningful relationships.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-tinder-or-bumble-better-for-guys></span>Is tinder or Bumble better for guys?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Bumble</b> is the winner for <b>guys</b>.<p>If you’re more hookup-oriented, however, you might have a <b>better</b> shot at that on <b>Tinder</b>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-guys-on-bumble-want-relationships></span>Do guys on Bumble want relationships?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Bumble</b> users are looking for commitment: 85% of <b>Bumble</b> users are looking for <b>marriage</b> or a boyfriend/girlfriend. <b>Bumble</b> is not known as a marketplace for hookups: Less than 4% of men and less than 1% of women on <b>Bumble</b> are looking for a hookup.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-bumble-for-serious-relationships></span>Is Bumble for serious relationships?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The short answer is yes, <b>Bumble</b> is for <b>serious relationships</b> and here’s why. <b>Bumble</b> has made conscious effort to brand itself as a <b>dating</b> app made for “connections” and not hookups. See these stats about <b>Bumble</b> from Mashable: hookups, their technology is based around keeping users safe and honest.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-i-pay-for-bumble></span>Should I pay for Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If you’re dating in a population-dense area like NYC or LA where there are a ton of other users, it’s likely worth going straight to <b>Bumble</b> Premium. All of the Boost features are included, and everything else your premium subscription unlocks <b>could</b> help you focus on the people with true relationship potential.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-get-the-beeline-on-bumble-without-paying></span>How do you get the Beeline on Bumble without paying?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>No, there is no way to <b>see</b> your <b>Bumble Beeline</b> profiles for free.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-weird-to-extend-on-bumble></span>Is it weird to extend on Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Extend</b> doesn’t mean anything. The woman didn’t text you when you first matched or in the first 24 hours because she’s either here for an ego boost or she’s kinda “meh” on you anyway. So as long as she’s got better options and doesn’t end up ridiculously bored, you’re never getting a message from her. <b>Extend</b> is creepy.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-bumble-punish-you-for-deleting-account></span>Does Bumble punish you for deleting account?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Yes and no. There are no automatic punishments or “shadow bans” for <b>deleting</b> and recreating your <b>Bumble</b> profile. Please note: If <b>you</b> recreate your profile multiple times, <b>you</b> can run the risk of getting warned or blocked from <b>Bumble</b> permanently.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-guys-on-bumble-see-when-you-look-at-their-profile></span>Can guys on Bumble see when you look at their profile?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Literally, the answer has to be ‘no’ unfortunately. <b>Bumble</b> officially doesn’t allow such things. It used to allow users to <b>see</b> when someone <b>you</b> have matched used the app for the last time. Not just ‘<b>Bumble</b>‘ though; all the swipe-based apps often don’t provide such privileges straightaway to the users.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-are-bumble-pictures-blurry></span>Why are bumble pictures blurry?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Blurry</b> matches mean they have already swiped right on you. <b>Bumble</b> calls it Bee line feature. To see who swiped right on you, you would have to purchase <b>Bumble</b> boost. It is basically a paid feature.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6pLTAp56eZZGcsm67zWaZrqWSobJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
