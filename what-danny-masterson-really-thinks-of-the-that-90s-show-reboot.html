Fans might argue that had Topher Grace stayed onboard for the duration, the show could've gone over the 200 episode mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nonetheless, the show received lots of fanfare, and the cast had a close relationship behind the scenes. However, speaking alongside The Chicago Tribune, <a href=#>Danny Masterson revealed that shooting the final episode was a very emotional process.</a></p><p>"There were people losing it while we were working on the last episode, of course," says Masterson."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Mila Kunis Had A Different Experience Shooting With Ashton Kutcher On That '90s Show, Compared To Their Time On That '70s Show</a></span></p><p>Masterson also decided to make a speech prior to the final episode and as expected, it was a very emotional one from the man that played Hyde for eight seasons on the show.</p><p>"I decided to take that time to tell everyone what they meant to me and how I felt about the past several years working with them. And that was so just the worst thing I could have done. From that moment on, I couldn't make eye contact with anyone else in the case without wanting to cry."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>17 years later, the show is getting a reboot. Although the actor won't be part of the show, he is very happy about the opportunity for two of his former cast members, in particular.</p><h2 id=danny-masterson-was-thrilled-for-debra-jo-rupp-and-kurtwood-smith-for-the-that-39-90s-show-reboot>Danny Masterson Was Thrilled For Debra Jo Rupp And Kurtwood Smith For The That '90s Show Reboot</h2><p>Back in October of 2021, Danny Masterson took to Instagram, expressing his joy in regard to the That '70s Show spinoff. At the time, it was announced that Netflix had reached a deal for the reboot, and Kurtwood Smith along with Debra Jo Rupp were confirmed for the series.</p><p>Not only was Masterson excited for the show, but he praised the involvement of his two former co-stars.</p><p>He said in the Instagram post, "This is literally the dopest thing I’ve heard in a decade. So fucking excited for @therealkurtwoodsmith and @debrajorupp two of the great humans and greatest actors on this planet. Can’t wait to watch and laugh. Same creators / writers / producers as 70s."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>What Happened To Christopher Masterson After That '70 Show?</a></span></p><p>Masterson hasn't commented on the series since, but it seems more than likely he'll be watching as a fan.</p><h2 id=danny-masterson-wasn-39-t-extended-an-invite-to-appear-on-the-that-39-90s-show-reboot>Danny Masterson Wasn't Extended An Invite To Appear On The That '90s Show Reboot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar49392340.jpg><p>It shouldn't come as a surprise, but Danny Masterson was among the only member of the main cast not to be extended an invite. Given his current court trial, matched with a troubled relationship with Netflix (he got fired from The Ranch), not getting to be on the reboot shouldn't be too surprising.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, according to Fox News, his days in court don't seem to be over with, as <a href=#>he's expected to start a new trial over again.</a></p><p>The statement reads, "The District Attorney’s Office will retry Mr. Masterson on the same counts," the DA said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital on Tuesday. "The next court date is Feb. 16 for a status conference. "Motion hearings are scheduled for March 6 and March 27. Jury selection in the retrial is set to begin March 29."</p><p>Masterson won't be working on any new projects either, as the actor hasn't worked on anything since getting the boot from his series alongside Ashton Kutcher in, The Ranch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGius2yZKaZo6mys7%2FOp2SrnZGhubp506Ggp6OjYrynedOhnGasmJbBboWPrGSsoJ%2BserOxwaimrWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
