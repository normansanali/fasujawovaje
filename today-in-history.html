The two had met ten years earlier at the wedding of Alexandra’s sister and Nicholas’ uncle, and Nicholas had decided to propose to her despite his parents’ opposition. Alexandra initially rejected his proposal due to religious differences — she was a Lutheran, he was Russian Orthodox — but her cousin Kaiser Wilhelm II convinced her that the marriage was her duty. The pair remained together until they were killed in 1918 by Bolshevik forces in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution.</p><h2>1922: Charles Schulz Is Born</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-392056 alt="Charles Schulz This Date In History" width=900 height=597 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/charles-schulz.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-392056 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Picryl</span><span class=caption-body>A young Charles Schulz with a drawing of Charlie Brown.</span></p><p>Charles Schulz, the creator of the beloved Peanuts comic strip, is born in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
