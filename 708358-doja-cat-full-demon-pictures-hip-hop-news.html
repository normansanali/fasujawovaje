After some fans complained about the playfully demonic imagery in the early singles from her new album Scarlet she doubled down. The third single from the album is literally called "Demons" and fans were fittingly upset that it's demonic and satanic. They called out the album cover for its imagery and Doja herself hit back hard. “Y’all so b*tchmade you probably couldn’t make it through an episode of ‘Goosebumps’, f*ckin p*ssies,” she said in an <a href=# rel>Instagram post directed at them</a>.</p><p>Doja Cat dropped the <a href=# rel>music video for the song overnight</a>. It features her dressed up as a demon haunting the dreams of Yellowjackets actress Christina Ricci. While that unsurprisingly resulted in some backlash from fans, it wasn't even the most controversial or viral thing she dropped last night. She shared some new pictures online that show her demon look in much more detail. Fans had a pretty stunned reaction to where Doja went with her new look. "Nah this is crazy," reads one of the top comments on the post. "How tf we get here from the cow song," another fan hilarious observes.

The latter has become a pretty successful hit vaulting into the top 5 of the Hot 100 this week.</p><p>Doja Cat has been extremely active on her Instagram recently.
