Anna shared that the pair are expecting their seventh child together — a baby girl — in April 2021. The news was announced with an Instagram reveal where the 19 Kids and Counting alums stood under an umbrella raining pink confetti as their kids ran around them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Since then, the pair have stayed together through many ups and downs — as well as the birth of six (and soon seven) children.</p><p>Anna shared that the pair are <a href=#>expecting their seventh child together</a> — a baby girl — in April 2021. The news was announced with an Instagram reveal where the 19 Kids and Counting alums stood under an umbrella raining pink confetti as their kids ran around them.</p><p>“It’s a GIRL!!!!!” the Florida native wrote in the caption alongside a pink bow emoji. “We are overjoyed to announce baby seven is on the way and we can’t wait to hold her in our arms this fall!”</p><p>Less than a week later, <a href=#>the eldest Duggar child was arrested</a> on April 29 and placed on federal hold at the Washington County jail in Arkansas. On April 30, the reality star pleaded not guilty to <a href=#>receiving and possessing child pornography</a>.</p><p>“According to court documents, Joshua James Duggar, 33, allegedly used the internet to download child sexual abuse material,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Arkansas said in a press release. “Duggar allegedly possessed this material, some of which depicts the sexual abuse of children under the age of 12, in May 2019.”</p><p>The family is no stranger to scandal. In August 2015, <a href=#>Josh found himself at the center of a large-scale cheating scandal</a> after website Ashley Madison was involved in a data leak. Months after the news broke, <a href=#>Anna addressed</a> her husband’s admitted affairs.</p><p>“It was definitely a hard thing, and I think it was such a betrayal for a spouse to go through what we’re walking through — and … it was hard,” she said during a December 2015 episode of Jill & Jessa: Counting On. “It was hard to realize that it was such a public thing, so not only was it a betrayal for me, but it was also a betrayal against those who call themselves Christian, because here we were as a Christian couple and everyone was able to see us get married and to vow before God to be loyal to each other. And [then] that loyalty was broken.”</p><p>Josh’s sister <a href=#><strong>Jinger Duggar</strong></a> and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Jeremy Vuolo</strong></a>, revealed that the <a href=#>scandal had brought their family closer</a> in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.</p><p>“It was one of the hardest times of our lives,” Jinger told Us in April 2021. “I will never forget how I felt in that moment. And I think even everything that happens in our lives — because we’re in the public eye — it makes it more challenging because then it’s not just dealing with these things inwardly, but you have to give an answer to the world. That makes it a much tougher thing to walk through.”</p><p>Following his scandals, Josh entered a <a href=#>six-month rehab program</a>. Two months after finishing the program in March 2016, the couple <a href=#>revealed they’d started marriage counseling</a> of their own.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Since the residential treatment program ended, we have been working with a professional marriage and family counselor to take important steps toward healing,” they wrote in a statement on the Duggar family’s website in May 2016. “As the future unfolds, we are taking one day at a time and we are grateful for your continued prayers for both of us and our sweet children.”</p><p>Scroll to see the reality TV personalities’ relationship through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt7C%2Fx2abrp%2BXlr9urc2dZJqmnpZ6pcHGoJirq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uwMimnKWhnpp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
