I’m grateful for what my body can do when I put my mind to it, even down to little things like going on a hike or taking a leisurely walk to a coffee shop instead of driving,” she explained. “It takes real strength to prioritize being kind to yourself.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The Australian actress admitted she didn’t always appreciate her body, though. “I started to recognize the work I needed to do to take care of myself after my first season of Reign, when I was 24. It was the most intense work schedule I’d ever been on. I learned quickly that I couldn’t cheat myself of sleep or skip meals because I wanted to work on my lines,” she recalled. “Ultimately, I had to be more considerate of my body and its needs. And over the last few years, my mindset has changed from ‘I need to take care of myself for work’ to ‘I need to take care of myself for me.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Adelaide-Kane-womens-health-nude-embed21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Adelaide makes it known she likes moving her body, as exemplified by the several posts on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> profile that show her enjoying the great outdoors and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>working out</a>.
