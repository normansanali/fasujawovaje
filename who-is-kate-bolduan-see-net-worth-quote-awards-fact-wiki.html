She is also widely recognized for her engagements in shows such as “New Day” and “State of America with Kate Bolduan”.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how much wealth this American journalist has accumulated so far? How rich Kate Bolduan is? According to sources, it is estimated that the total of Kate Bolduan’s net worth, as of early 2018, revolves around the sum of $3 million which has been acquired through her journalistic career which has been active since the mid 2000s.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kate-bolduan-net-worth-3-million></span><strong>Kate Bolduan Net Worth $3 Million</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kate was born the third of four daughters of nurse Nadine, and doctor Jeffrey Bolduan. She began her education at Goshen High School after which she enrolled at George Washington University from which she graduated in 2005, earning her Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism. During her studies, she was a member of the women’s volleyball team, and was also regularly involved within the student’s theatre organization. Kate began her professional journalist career subsequent to her graduation, when she began serving as a general assignment reporter for North Carolina’s WTVD TV. This job provided the basis for Kate Bolduan’s current net worth.</p><p>Later she relocated to Washington D.C., and made her on-camera debut as a production assistant of NBC News. Besides this, she also worked for the MSNBC as well as for “NBC Nightly News”, “Dateline NBC” and House and Garden magazine. In the late 2000s, Kate transferred to CNN where she landed the job of the national correspondent for the CNN “Newsource”. She compiled numerous feature reports for the majority of CNN Newsource affiliates, including notable topics such as the Minneapolis Bridge collapse in 2007, and the 2008 US Presidential elections, among plenty of others. All these accolades helped Kate Bolduan to add sums to the total of her wealth.</p><p>Prior to moving to New York City and becoming the anchor of CNN’s morning TV show “New Day” in June 2013, Kate served as a co-anchor of “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer”, covering breaking news, current events as well as political headlines. In January 2015, alongside John Berman, Kate began serving as a co-host of the morning show “At This Hour”, covering various stories, news and current events reports. Since February 2017, the show airs as “At This Hour with Kate Bolduan” as she is currently its sole host. It is certain that all these engagements and accomplishments have helped Kate Bolduan to dramatically increase the total size of her net worth.</p><p>Apart from all those already mentioned above, Bolduan had also served as the host of CNN International’s covering of the 2016 US Presidential elections.</p><p>When it comes to her personal life, since 2010 Kate has been married to real estate businessman Michael David Gershenson, with whom she has welcomed two daughters.
