Mulaney, who married makeup artist <a href=#><strong>Annamarie Tendler</strong></a> in July 2014, reflected on his teenage drinking habit during a September 2019 interview with <a href=#>Esquire</a>.</p><p>“I drank for attention,” the former <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> writer explained at the time. “I was really outgoing, and then at 12, I wasn’t. I didn’t know how to act. And then I was drinking, and I was hilarious again.”</p><p>Experimenting with drugs followed suit. “I never liked smoking pot. Then I tried cocaine, and I loved it,” Mulaney told the outlet. “I wasn’t a good athlete, so maybe it was some young male thing of, ‘This is the physical feat I can do. Three Vicodin and a tequila and I’m still standing. Who’s the athlete now?'”</p><p>The Big Mouth star stopped using cocaine in August 2005 at age 23 and quit drinking the following month.</p><p>“I went on a bender that weekend that was just, like, fading in and out of a movie,” he remembered. “It was just crazy. A weekend that was … there were … I’m never going to tell you. That’s mine. I didn’t kill anyone or assault anyone. But yeah, I was like, ‘You’re f–king out of control.’ And I thought to myself, ‘I don’t like this guy anymore. I’m not rooting for him.'”</p><p>At the time, Mulaney didn’t use a recovery program or counseling, but instead <a href=#>quit abusing substances</a> cold turkey. According to Esquire, he had never fallen off the wagon since.</p><p>Mulaney recently took <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a> under his wing as the 27-year-old New York native has continued to <a href=#>struggle with his own mental health issues</a> in the public eye. In December 2018, Davidson shared suicidal thoughts in an Instagram post after splitting from fiancée<a href=#><strong> Ariana Grande</strong></a>. One month later, Mulaney joined the King of Staten Island actor on a “Weekend Update” segment on SNL.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve been spending time with Pete to try to show him that you can have <a href=#>a life in comedy that is not insane</a> — a sober, domestic life,” Mulaney teased at the time as the twosome prepared to hit the road together for a comedy tour. “Pete, look at me. You are loved by many and we are glad you are OK.”</p><p>Mulaney <a href=#>hosted SNL for the fourth time</a> in October. The following month, he took a job writing on Late Night With Seth Meyers to bring more structure back into his life <a href=#>amid the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p><p>“During quarantine, I was like, ‘Why am I going totally crazy and why am I suddenly telling my wife my accomplishments?’ Like, ‘I had a Comedy Central Presents when I was 23 years old,'” he joked during an appearance on <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a> in December. “I really needed a job. One, I like having a boss, I like having assignments to do. When I’m in charge of something, [it’s] not so much the best thing. I wanted to have a boss and I wanted to have structure. Because my psychiatrist, who knows me well, said, ‘Without external structure, I don’t have confidence in you thriving.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5ijeq7By5qlnrFdnsBuv8SeoqKml2LBs7HAraSepqRis7C%2BjJqjnKeYpLlusNGunmaZkqrApns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
