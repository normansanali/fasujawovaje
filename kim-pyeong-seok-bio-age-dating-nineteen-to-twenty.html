A week from they started filming, nineteen-year-old characters in the television series Nineteen to Twenty will become twenty. They receive life lessons in the final week of December while they are still 19 years old, broadening their horizons.</p><p>Moreover, they will study topics including food, economics, and interpersonal interactions at School 19. They spend their last week as teenagers at this location.</p><p>There is just one restriction: dating is not permitted. They all become adults on January 1 because South Korea is the only country that does so regardless of one’s birthday; as a result, they spend their first week as adults in House 20 without any constraints. The best times of these young people’s lives will be shared by them.</p><p>Lim has appeared on the show with his fellow cast members Moon Se Yeon, Jeong Seo Yeong, Choi Seo Hyeon, Ph Sang Won, Noh Hee Ji, Lee Ji Min, Choi Ye Rin, Jeong Ji Woo, and Kim Pyeong Seok.</p><p>The participants are required to attend lessons at a unique “19 School” during their final years of adolescence, where they have the opportunity to make new friends. When they turn 20, they’ll relocate to the “20 House.” How precisely the South Korean age system functions may be one of the more intriguing aspects of this particular show for viewers from other countries. It turns out that everyone in this Asian nation is regarded as having reached adulthood at birth. Their official age grows by one every year, which causes South Korea to celebrate January 1 quite a bit.</p><p>The entirety of Nineteen to Twenty was shot in South Korea, particularly in and around Seoul. It seems natural that the reality series’ production crew shoots the episodes there because the program is about young Korean adults attempting to enter adulthood.</p><p>The production crew primarily pitches their tents at and around Choong Ang High School, which is located at 164 Changdeokgung-gil in Seoul’s Jongno-gu district. At the university, both inside and outside, several significant scenes are captured as the young adults interact and share special moments.</p><p>Other sources report that the show was filmed at Jungang High School in Seoul.</p><p>According to The Cinemaholic, “several other landmarks and attractions might feature in the Netflix series. Some are the 63 Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, the N Seoul Tower, Lotte World, Trade Tower, COEX, IFC Seoul, and the Parc1.”</p><p>The four hosts of the Netflix program are another important consideration. Throughout the show, Cho Kyu-hyun, Kim Ji-Eun, Lee Su-hyun, and Jung Se-Woon can be seen responding to the events taking place at the “19 School” and the “20 House.” Their position as audience members surely fosters a sense of community among viewers as they can join them in gushing over the advancements occurring among the participants.</p><h3><strong>Kim Pyeong Seok On Netflix’s Nineteen to Twenty</strong></h3><p>Kim Pyeong Seok desires to instruct hapkido. His father has a hapkido school, and he has won countless events since he was a young child. He triumphed in a global martial arts competition as well. At the hapkido center, he instructs young children.</p><p>In the afternoons, he drives the van to pick up pupils from various locations. His friends claim that while he can be difficult to approach at first, they eventually realized he is entertaining and even a little awkward.</p><p>So, based on our research, Pyeong Seok is working at Kimjaeuk Hapkido (<a href=#>@kju_hapkido_2000</a>) run by grandmaster KJU. He also appears to be one of the representatives at the Olympics ‘2022 Online World Martial Arts Masterships. The event was hosted by the World Martial Arts Masterships Committee (Chairperson Si-Jong Lee, WMC) and the tournament ran from the 18th to the 23rd of October.</p><p>The 6-day journey began with the oath of athlete representatives by Kim Pyeong-seok (Yeonmu) and Kim Min-seo (Korea Hapkido), Lee Eun-ho (Taekwondo) and Choi Young-mi (Kendo) referees, followed by the opening declaration by Cha Byeong-gyu, chairman of NMC Korea.</p><p>The intended goal of the online <a href=#>World Martial Arts Mastership</a>, which was launched in 2021 as a result of the Corona 19 epidemic, was to completely replace the face-to-face tournament. This competition, which will take place twice this year, is anticipated to demonstrate longevity as an autonomous competitive brand known as an on-offline hybrid—a term that only online World Martial Arts Masterships possess—even beyond the pandemic.</p><p>Furthermore, he also appears to be a record holder who stood high fall at 1.80 meters, and a far fall of 3.85 meters. He is a part of the <span class="tiktok-j2a19r-SpanText efbd9f0">NMC Korea Demonstration Team.</span></p><h3><strong>Is Kim Pyeong Seok Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>Kim Pyeong Seok’s dating life is unclear at the time of this writing.
