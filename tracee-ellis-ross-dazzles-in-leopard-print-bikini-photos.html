The Girlfriends alum, 50, was a glowing sight in a series of mirror selfies posted via Instagram on Monday, April 10. Ross looked sunkissed and fit in the animal print two-piece that featured a string top and low-rise bottoms.

I just want you to know I just bent my knee … just bent it and it hurt. It was like ouch, which is exactly what happens when I wake up in the morning now,” Ross told her followers. “I wake up at 50 —&nbsp;hot as ever —&nbsp;and it’s as if someone beat me up while I was asleep.
