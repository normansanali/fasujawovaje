However, a recent trend towards miniaturized workstations has been observed. While systems in the GEEKOM AS 6's form-factor are still not capable enough to become workstations, the rapid performance improvements over the years has encouraged us to benchmark some of these UCFF / SFF systems for content creation workloads and professional applications. Towards this, we processed the SPECworkstation 3.1 benchmark from SPEC.</p><p>The SPECworkstation 3.1 benchmark measures workstation performance based on a number of professional applications. It includes more than 140 tests based on 30 different workloads that exercise the CPU, graphics, I/O and memory hierarchy. These workloads fall into different categories.</p><ul><li>Media and Entertainment (3D animation, rendering)</li><li>Product Development (CAD/CAM/CAE)</li><li>Life Sciences (medical, molecular)</li><li>Financial Services</li><li>Energy (oil and gas)</li><li>General Operations</li><li>GPU Compute</li></ul><p>Individual scores are generated for each test and a composite score for each category is calculated based on a reference machine (HP Z240 tower workstation using an Intel E3-1240 v5 CPU, an AMD Radeon Pro WX3100 GPU, 16GB of DDR4-2133, and a SanDisk 512GB SSD). Official benchmark results generated automatically by the benchmark itself are linked in the table below for the systems being compared.</p><p>Details of the tests in each category, as well as an overall comparison of the systems on a per-category basis are presented below.</p><p><b>Media and Entertainment</b></p><p>The <i>Media and Entertainment</i> category comprises of workloads from five distinct applications:</p><ul><li>The <i>Blender</i> workload measures system performance for content creation using the open-source <a href=#>Blender</a> application. Tests include rendering of scenes of varying complexity using the OpenGL and ray-tracing renderers.</li><li>The <i>Handbrake</i> workload uses the open-source <a href=#>Handbrake</a> application to transcode a 4K H.264 file into a H.265 file at 4K and 2K resolutions using the CPU capabilities alone.</li><li>The <i>LuxRender</i> workload benchmarks the <a href=#>LuxCore</a> physically based renderer using <a href=#>LuxMark</a>.</li><li>The <i>Maya</i> workload uses the SPECviewperf 13 maya-05 viewset to replay traces generated using the Autodesk Maya 2017 application for 3D animation.</li><li>The <i>3ds Max</i> workload uses the SPECviewperf 13 3dsmax-06 viewset to replay traces generated by Autodesk's 3ds Max 2016 using the default Nitrous DX11 driver. The workload represents system usage for 3D modeling tasks.</li></ul><p><img alt="SPECworkstation 3.1 - Media and Entertainment" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph18964/SPECworkstation_3.1_SWS-Media-and-Entertainment.png width=100% style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This category sees the Raptor Lake-P and Rembrandt systems getting ordered on the basis of the configured sustained TDP. The 4X4 BOX-7735U enjoys a lead with its 42W TDP, and the 40W RPL-P systems (including the Arena Canyon NUC) follow behind. The GEEKOM AS 6 with its 35W setting is in the middle of the pack, ahead of the previous generation systems.</p><p><b>Product Development</b></p><p>The <i>Product Development</i> category comprises of eight distinct workloads:</p><ul><li>The <i>Rodinia (CFD)</i> workload benchmarks a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithm.</li><li>The <i>WPCcfd</i> workload benchmarks another CFD algorithm involving combustion and turbulence modeling.</li><li>The <i>CalculiX</i> workload uses the <a href=#>Calculix</a> finite-element analysis program to model a jet engine turbine's internal temperature.</li><li>The <i>Catia</i> workload uses the catia-05 viewset from SPECviewperf 13 to replay traces generated by Dassault Systemes' CATIA V6 R2012 3D CAD application.</li><li>The <i>Creo</i> workload uses the creo-02 viewset from SPECviewperf 13 to replay traces generated by PTC's Creo, a 3D CAD application.</li><li>The <i>NX</i> workload uses the snx-03 viewset from SPECviewperf 13 to replay traces generated by the Siemens PLM NX 8.0 CAD/CAM/CAE application.</li><li>The <i>Solidworks</i> workload uses the sw-04 viewset from SPECviewperf 13 to replay traces generated by Dassault Systemes' SolidWorks 2013 SP1 CAD/CAE application.</li><li>The <i>Showcase</i> workload uses the showcase-02 viewset from SPECviewperf 13 to replay traces from Autodesk???s Showcase 2013 3D visualization and presentation application</li></ul><p><img alt="SPECworkstation 3.1 - Product Development" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph18964/SPECworkstation_3.1_SWS-Product-Development.png width=100% style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The trend observed in the <i>Media and Entertainment</i> category repeats here, with the 4X4 BOX-7735U faring better than the GEEKOM AS 6.</p><p><b>Life Sciences</b></p><p>The <i>Life Sciences</i> category comprises of four distinct test sets:</p><ul><li>The <i>LAMMPS</i> set comprises of five tests simulating different molecular properties using the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator.</li><li>The <i>NAMD</i> set comprises of three tests simulating different molecular interactions.</li><li>The <i>Rodinia (Life Sciences)</i> set comprises of four tests - the <i>Heartwall</i> medical imaging algorithm, the <i>Lavamd</i> algorithm for calculation of particle potential and relocation in a 3D space due to mutual forces, the <i>Hotspot</i> algorithm to estimate processor temperature with thermal simulations, and the <i>SRAD</i> anisotropic diffusion algorithm for denoising.</li><li>The <i>Medical</i> workload uses the medical-02 viewset from SPECviewperf 13 to determine system performance for the Tuvok rendering core in the ImageVis3D volume visualization program.</li></ul><p><img alt="SPECworkstation 3.1 - Life Sciences" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph18964/SPECworkstation_3.1_SWS-Life-Sciences.png width=100% style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The addition of a GPU-centric component in the workload allows the GEEKOM AS 6 to leapfrog the RPL-P-based systems, but the 42W configuration of the Ryzen 7 7735U still remains on top.</p><p><b>Financial Services</b></p><p>The <i>Financial Services</i> workload set benchmarks the system for three popular algorithms used in the financial services industry - the Monte Carlo probability simulation for risk assessment and forecast modeling, the Black-Scholes pricing model, and the Binomial Options pricing model.</p><p><img alt="SPECworkstation 3 - Financial Services" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph18964/SPECworkstation_3.1_SWS-Financial-Services.png width=100% style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>While the 42W configuration of the 4X4 BOX-7735U continues to remain on top, some of the components in this workload are also better served with high single-threaded performance. We see the Arena Canyon NUC slotting into the second place, with the GEEKOM AS 6 slipping to third, and the TDP ordering being maintained.</p><p><b>Energy</b></p><p>The <i>Energy</i> category comprises of workloads simulating various algorithms used in the oil and gas industry:</p><ul><li>The <i>FFTW</i> workload computes discrete Fourier transforms of large matrices.</li><li>The <i>Convolution</i> workload computes the convolution of a random 100x100 filter on a 400 megapixel image.</li><li>The <i>SRMP</i> workload processes the Surface-Related Multiples Prediction algorithm used in seismic data processing.</li><li>The <i>Kirchhoff Migration</i> workload processes an algorithm to calculate the back propogation of a seismic wavefield.</li><li>The <i>Poisson</i> workload takes advantage of the OpenMP multi-processing framework to solve the Poisson's equation.</li><li>The <i>Energy</i> workload uses the energy-02 viewset from SPECviewperf 13 to determine system performance for the open-source OPendTec seismic visualization application.</li></ul><p><img alt="SPECworkstation 3 - Energy" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph18964/SPECworkstation_3.1_SWS-Energy.png width=100% style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This workload also includes a GPU-centric component, and that helps the GEEKOM AS 6 and the other high TDP Rembrandt system come out in the top two (with the difference being in the realm of run-to-run variations). The high-performance RPL-P system (NUC BOX-1360P/D5) also delivers very similar performance.</p><p><b>General Operations</b></p><p>In the <i>General Options</i> category, the focus is on workloads from widely used applications in the workstation market:</p><ul><li>The <i>7zip</i> workload represents compression and decompression operations using the open-source 7zip file archiver program.</li><li>The <i>Python</i> workload benchmarks math operations using the numpy and scipy libraries along with other Python features.</li><li>The <i>Octave</i> workload performs math operations using the Octave programming language used in scientific computing.</li><li>The <i>Storage</i> workload evaluates the performance of the underlying storage device using transaction traces from multiple workstation applications.</li></ul><p><img alt="SPECworkstation 3 - General Operations" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph18964/SPECworkstation_3.1_SWS-General-Operations.png width=100% style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The components in this workload benefit from single-threaded performance as well as high-performance storage subsystems. The SSD used in the Arena Canyon NUC, NUC BOX-1360P/D5, and 4X4 BOX-7735U use SSDs with DRAM for the FTL, while the GEEKOM AS 6 came pre-configured with a DRAM-less SSD for cost optimization. As a result, there is a significant gulf in the scores of the other systems and the GEEKOM AS 6, with the latter making an entry in the bottom half of the pack.</p><p><b>GPU Compute</b></p><p>In the <i>GPU Compute</i> category, the focus is on workloads taking advantage of the GPU compute capabilities using either OpenCL or CUDA, as applicable:</p><ul><li>The <i>LuxRender</i> benchmark is the same as the one seen in the media and entertainment category.</li><li>The <i>Caffe</i> benchmark measures the performance of the Caffe deep-learning framework.</li><li>The <i>Folding@Home</i> benchmark measures the performance of the system for distributed computing workloads focused on tasks such as protein folding and drug design.</li></ul><p>We only process the OpenCL variants of the benchmark, but the Intel iGPU drivers have an issue with the <i>Caffe</i> benchmark. All the Intel-based systems have a default 0.01 scoring for that component, and we see that reflected in their appearance in the bottom half of the graph below.</p><p><img alt="SPECworkstation 3 - GPU Compute" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph18964/SPECworkstation_3.1_SWS-GPU-Compute.png width=100% style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Within the Rembrandt-based systems, the 42W configuration of the Ryzen 7 7735U has the edge over the 35W Ryzen 9 6900HX in the GEEKOM AS 6, relegating it to the second place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH55hZVtZqCdlaC8rnnArGRvZZGowrR5z6dsbGWimsOqsdZmqbKylaN6enmVcmdpoKhivaKvyqxkqa2emLWmv4yipWaZXaWytbXTnmSpmZOgrqixjm8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
