During one interview, the two played a game, attempting to guess famous songs that were being played by The Roots. When one of Swift's own song's was played however, she didn't seem to know it. Realizing she’d failed to recognize her own work, Swift even seemed to storm off the stage.</p><h2 id=jimmy-fallon-and-taylor-swift-played-name-that-song>Jimmy Fallon And Taylor Swift Played Name That Song</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jimmy-Fallon-Taylor-Swift-promo-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Host Jimmy Fallon of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon! has had several hilarious, emotional, awkward and memorable moments on his show. Not every guest seems to like the host when on the show, like when <a href=#>Martin Short threw shade at Fallon during their interview</a>.</p><p>The host does have several celebrity friends, including star Taylor Swift. <a href=#>The star once surprised Fallon with an incredibly emotional moment on The Tonight Show, nearly bringing him to tears</a>.</p><p>When Taylor Swift made another visit to The Tonight Show to have a chat with Jimmy Fallon, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two played a game called "name that song."</a></p><p>Before the host and Swift started playing, Fallon explained the rules: "The Roots are gonna start playing a song, one instrument at a time. Taylor and I can buzz in and guess as soon as we know the song. But if you guess wrong, the other person gets a chance to steal."</p><p>"Treacherous, crazy." the singer joked. Fallon, chuckling added, "You can play along at home," before they got started.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once the game started, The Roots (The Tonight Show's house band and Grammy-winning legends in hip-hop), began playing the first song.</p><p>The first song, Fallon guessed wrong, with "Oops... I Did it Again by Britney Spears". However, he got the singer right, and Swift quickly figured out the song, Spears' hit, Baby One More Time. "It's them Max Martin chords!" Swift said, laughing with Fallon.</p><p>After Swift won the first round, Fallon felt Swift would definitely beat him at the game, commenting, "I'm so mad! Alright. Ugh. Of course Taylor's gonna kill me at this." The Shake It Off singer smiled and agreed.</p><p>As the two battled back and forth, Swift got several songs right some almost immediately, telling Fallon "It's the chords," which helped her recognize certain songs. Fallon also got some right, including one of Swift's own songs!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-failed-to-recognize-her-own-song-shake-it-off>Taylor Swift Failed To Recognize Her Own Song, Shake It Off</h2><p>While Taylor Swift and Jimmy Fallon were playing "name that song" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon!, Swift surprised Fallon by recognizing certain songs quickly.</p><p>When they got to the final song however, it was pretty surprising that Swift didn't recognize it, especially considering it was one of her own hits!</p><p>The host announced, "All right, it's time for the final song," joking that "this is worth 10,000 points." When Swift asked, "Towards what?" Fallon said, "It's anyone's game. Whoever wins this, wins the whole game," which brought laughter from the audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As The Roots began playing, Swift listened, but didn't seem to recognize the song they were playing. As Fallon listened, he was leaned down over the buzzer, his hand above it.</p><p>As more instruments joined in, he glanced up, seeming to know the song, and buzzed in. He guessed, "Shake It Off." Swift's face remained completely unchanged until it was revealed the host was correct.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" Never Would Have Happened If It Wasn't For Her Mom</a></span></p><p>At first the star seemed almost shocked, breaking out into a smile, starting to laugh, but she also seemed a little embarrassed too, as Fallon danced around the stage, grinning and yelling, "Yeah! Haha! Yeah!"</p><p>Glancing down, she turned to walk off the stage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-jimmy-fallon-cause-taylor-swift-to-storm-off-the-stage>Did Jimmy Fallon Cause Taylor Swift To Storm Off The Stage?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jimmy-fallon-looking-uncomfortable.jpg><p>After Swift was able to recognize multiple songs within moments, she seemed stunned that she hadn't recognized her own work. As the host danced around his guest in victory, Swift looked down, turned around and began walking off the stage.</p><p>It seemed as though Swift was a little upset she hadn't recognized her song. As Fallon continued celebrating that he'd beaten her, and she walked away, Fallon pointed at her walking and laughed, then quickly ran over to her to stop her.</p><p>Before she could reach the curtain, Fallon reached her. Still laughing, he said, "I'm sorry. No, no, no. Come on." As he put his arm around Swift and brought her back on the stage, he added, "That's my favorite thing that ever happened on the whole show ever!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon Broke Down In Tears After Taylor Swift Did This On 'The Tonight Show'</a></span></p><p>Swift's walk-off seemed to be more of a joke response to Fallon gloating that he had guessed her song first, and the two seemed to end the game on good terms. Several fans loved watching their interactions while they guessed songs.</p><p>Some even commented that the host should use more game formats with his guests. One fan said, "I love when Jimmy does stuff like this, he's hilarious! Stop with the interviews just do things like this with your guests."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llpa2rbHDZquoZaKasLCzzaKxnmWYmr9uu9anZKynnpx6pcHRoqWgZaSku6qzx61krKCfrHq4tdOhZKOhnaLGbrLApaOopl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
