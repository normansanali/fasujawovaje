Even though her co-stars Michael Richards, Jason Alexander and Jerry Seinfeld all showcased their comedic talents on the show, the actress's portrayal of this witty character felt unique and impressive.</p><p>Even though Seinfeld had a large fanbase during the 1990s and has been beloved ever since, life behind-the-scenes wasn't always smooth. For instance, the <a href=#>Seinfeld cast didn't like Heidi Swedberg</a>, and <a href=#>Seinfeld guest stars shared some awkward experiences</a>. However, Seinfeld fans would think that the four main cast members were the best of friends while filming the hit show and afterward. Here's whether that is actually true.</p><h2 id=did-julia-louis-dreyfus-get-along-with-her-co-stars-while-filming-seinfeld>Did Julia Louis-Dreyfus Get Along With Her Co-Stars While Filming Seinfeld?</h2><p>During every season of Seinfeld, Elaine Benes had problems big and small. She struggled to deal with the people around her, was frustrated more often than not, and didn't always love the apartment that she lived in. She dated regularly, but she never seemed to fall in love. Most of all, she made fans laugh constantly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Julia-Louis-Dreyfus-Seinfeld-Featured-Image.jpg><p>Whenever Louis-Dreyfus gave interviews about playing Elaine Benes on Seinfeld, she didn't say that she and her co-stars were incredibly good pals. However, several years after the series finale, she did share that the cast had a nice bond as a result of working so closely together for such a long time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Julia Louis-Dreyfus Swears Martha Stewart Hates Her, And Going On Ellen Together Didn't Help</a></span></p><p>In April 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia Louis-Dreyfus talked about the end of Seinfeld</a> in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. She also mentioned that Jerry Seinfeld shared some wise words when they were filming the series finale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She said, "We used to do this thing before [the shoot]. We always would come together in a huddle, the four of us [Jerry Seinfeld, Michael Richards, Jason Alexander and Louis-Dreyfus], and put our arms around each other and just do a little getting-jazzed moment together. And on this night, we all got together and we all just started to cry. And it was very surprising."</p><p>The actress continued to The Hollywood Reporter, "And I remember Jerry saying something like, ‘We’ll always have this and we’ll always be tied to one another, because of this experience.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/one-of-seinfeld-s-most-iconic-recurring-guest-stars-was-in-shock-he-got-invite-for-the-finale-thinking-jerry-seinfeld-and-larry-david-hated-him.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Daily Mail, Jason Alexander said during a 2020 interview with The Project that he and the others were polite and friendly when they were on set together. However, according to him, they didn't spend time together if they weren't filming, which might be pretty surprising for fans to hear about. The actor said, "We were never social friends, we were work friends. We had very different lives."</p><p>The beloved actor who fans loved watching play the hysterical George Costanza did say that he bonded with Louis-Dreyfus as they were both parents. It does seem that they had a positive professional relationship.</p><h2 id=what-is-julia-louis-dreyfus-39-s-relationship-with-her-seinfeld-co-stars-like-today>What Is Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Relationship With Her Seinfeld Co-Stars Like Today?</h2><p>Fans of Seinfeld would love to know that when the sitcom ended in 1998, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and her co-stars stayed in each other's lives. It would be nice to hear that they take annual trips together and have frequent dinner dates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jerry-seinfeld-had-a-secret-huddle-with-his-main-seinfeld-co-stars-prior-to-the-finale-leaving-everyone-teary-eyed.jpg><p>While Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards, and Jerry Seinfeld don't seem to hang out together as a foursome on a regular basis, they have definitely seen each other over the years.</p><p>In 2015, The Wrap reported that Seinfeld, Richards, and Alexander were having a great time at an event for a charity called Baby Buggy.</p><p>In her 2016 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Louis-Dreyfus was asked about being in contact with her fellow cast members. She said, “Yes. We don’t talk all the time. But it’s really great.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is The One Co-Star Julia Louis-Dreyfus Didn't Mind Kissing On 'Seinfeld'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it seems that some of the Seinfeld cast members get along better today than others do. It's possible that Louis-Dreyfus chats with Seinfeld more than with Richards and Alexander. In 2018, Seinfeld was interviewed by Entertainment Tonight about the fact that she had been diagnosed with cancer. He said, "She's doing great. I talk to her all the time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/julia-louis-dreyfus.jpg><p>Louis-Dreyfus and Alexander are always happy to chat with each other, though. Over the years, they have gotten together for both professional and personal reasons.</p><p>In 2017, Us Weekly reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander supported Louis-Dreyfus when she had cancer</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He said, “My wife went through this a couple years ago. When we first heard about Julia — I know she has breast cancer, I don’t know much more. We sent her emails saying ‘You must have a huge circuit of people closer than us to talk and share stories.’ I find that women and couples and families that have been through this, they all pay it forward. So the minute you hear someone’s going through it, everybody says, ‘Do you need to talk? Do you need advice? Do you need contacts, doctors — ‘ Whatever it may be."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Decision To Open Up About Her Cancer Diagnosis Was Partly Due To Her Role On 'Veep'</a></span></p><p>Alexander explained that although he and his co-stars reached out to Louis-Dreyfus, they didn't get a response. He said, "So we said all of that to Julia and we haven’t, you know, heard back from her, which is fine, that just means there’s special people around her.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AFFC3BE3-905D-42F3-8C35-A416FDE9E0EB.jpeg><p>Even if she didn't answer Alexander's email, Louis-Dreyfus did get together with him in a professional capacity a few years later. In May 2020, People reported that the actors chatted about the sitcom online and received donations for a cause called Direct Relief. Louis-Dreyfus said to Alexander during the talk, "I can't stand it, I'm so happy to see you!"</p><p>Whenever the actress talks about Seinfeld, she sounds grateful to have starred on the TV show. She also often talks about how much she cares about her fellow actors. She told People in May 2023, "There was a real grief period when the show ended that was real and felt. Because we all loved each other so much." The four main Seinfeld cast members might not all be best friends, but they do seem to have a mutual love and respect for one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrqSZlnqtu9SiqmacoprGp8HSZqqeoZ6bsq2wjJyYrKxdm7%2Bqsc2dqmasn5muuns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
