しかし、遂にはファンクラブを強制的に退会させられてしまいました。
なんと橋浦麻美子はファンクラブのメッセージ機能を使用し、そこから卑猥な画像を送り付けていたのです。
これにはスピッツの所属事務所も堪らず彼女に警告文を送りました。時期にして２００７年です。
が、橋浦さんはこの警告を無視。
警告文を受け取ったあと、反省するわけでもなくこの警告文をネットに投稿。
その後もストーカー行為を続け、結果ファンクラブを強制退会される事態となりました。
その後に２ちゃんねる上に自分の顔写真と共もメッセージを送っていました。
この内容を読んでる限り、自分が彼の彼女ではないことは理解してるような気がするのですが・・・。
また、彼女は自分のブログなどに自分の体の写真や、卑猥なことをしてる動画を出していたそうです。
草野マサムネが体調不良でライブ中止になったことも 橋浦麻美子さんのストーカー行為がシャレにならない出来事がありました。
それはスピッツの2011年のライブツアーの時期です。
この２０１１年のライブは草野マサムネさんの体調不良により延期となりました。
中止の理由は体調不良で、その原因は東日本大震災により過度のストレスを感じたからだと言われていました。
スピッツの公式ホームページでの病名は急性気管支炎と急性咽頭喉頭炎と発表されています。
ファンの間では、体調不良の理由はそれだけではなく、実は橋浦麻美子のストーカー被害にあっていたことも理由のひとつだと言われていました。
せっかく楽しみにしていたライブが中止になったということで、当時のファンの橋浦さんへの怒りは凄まじかったです。
草野マサムネと勘違いしたメル友と結婚を断られ１億円の慰謝料を請求。出会い系のサクラに騙された疑惑も 昔、橋浦麻美子には当時メル友がいたそうです。
橋浦さんはメル友を草野マサムネさんだと思い込んでおり、結婚の約束までしていたそうです。
一部では出会い系のサクラに草野さんになりすましてる人がいて、橋浦さんはそのなりすましのサクラに騙されていただけではないか？との説もあります。
橋浦さんが草野さんの個人情報を突き止めたきっかけも、そのメル友に住所と電話番号をたずねましたが教えて貰えなかったため、興信所を使ったのが始まりだとされてます。
橋浦さんはメル友に「子供が欲しい」と伝えましたが、結婚を断られ、これを「婚約破棄」だとして、警察に相談したり1億円もの慰謝料を請求したといわれています。
橋浦麻美子の現在の仕事。京都内でチャットレディやスタジオ会社に勤務しているとの噂 ファンクラブから締め出され、その後に結婚にも失敗した橋浦麻美子さん。
現在は匿名掲示板からも姿を消して、近況は不明です。
ただ、一時期、チャットレディに彼女にそっくりな人がいるとの目撃がありました。
また、カメラの専門学校を卒業してるとのことで、フォトスタジオに勤務してるのではないか？という説もあります。
一時期は精神的な病気を患っているということで、国からのお金で生活してるとの説もありました。</description></item><item><title>Andrew Lloyd Webber Net worth, Age: Kids, Weight, Wife, Bio-Wiki</title><link>/andrew-lloyd-webber.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/andrew-lloyd-webber.html</guid><description>Are you a follower of Andrew Lloyd Webber?
