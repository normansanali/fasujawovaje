She wore a similar costume to the one she wore for the New York Times photograph, except this time it was an all-white Grace Ling ensemble. Her toned abs were highlighted by her elegant clothing. Rob Zangardi and Mariel Haenn styled the star.</p><h2>Who exactly is Grace Ling?</h2><p>The designer, who was born in Singapore, is presently based in New York. Grace Ling studied fashion design at New York City’s Parsons School of Design and London’s Central Saint Martins. Along with her schooling, she worked at prestigious companies such as Thom Browne and The Row.&nbsp;Prior to design, Ling studied sculpture and performance art, which inspired and prompted her to pursue a career in fashion. She discovered multilayered fashion, which included film, performance, and cooperation.&nbsp;Grace began her modeling career at the age of 16, both in front of and behind the camera. She was also a bridesmaid in the Hollywood film Crazy Rich Asians.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grace-Ling-2.jpg alt="Grace Ling" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Grace’s designs show her focus on unconventional elegance and sophisticated femininity. All of her classic designs are of high quality and material, with precise tailoring and whimsical accents. Sustainability is seen as a design process by the label. It combines fashion with uncommon 3D technologies such as CAD, CGI, and 3D printing. The firm achieves zero waste by using calculative approaches to choose the precise quantity of materials required for its creations.&nbsp;Grace Ling’s work has also appeared in Vogue Italia, Vogue Singapore, and 1 Granary Magazine. Diane Pernet’s ASVOFF x Artsthread x FNL Network 2020 International Fashion Film Festival in Paris was awarded the Grand Prize to the fashion designer.</p><h2>Other celebrities are seen wearing Grace Ling outfits</h2><p>Apart from Jennifer Lopez, Karlie Kloss was also spotted wearing the emerging label’s ensemble for November’s WSJ, where she combined the same bralette with a cutaway jacket priced at $1,690 and sheer-paneled slacks priced at $890.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGieq5mTmnqttc2gZK2glWKxpr%2FIoKWeql2Xsqm1zZ1ko6SfqHqurdGrsGallWK9s7vMqKuip55ivLbAxaKrrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
