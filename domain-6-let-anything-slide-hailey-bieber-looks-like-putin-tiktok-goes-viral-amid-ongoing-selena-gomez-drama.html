A photo of a much younger Hailey was compared to a picture of a young Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Twitter account Pop Base shared the two images side-by-side and asked why the current President of Russia looked like Hailey Bieber when he was young.</p><p>Since the comparison, other people on the internet were also able to spot the uncanny resemblance between the two. They have since created TikTok videos to compare Hailey’s face to Putin’s, making the 26-year-old socialite go viral again.</p><p>As such, user @damnncaps on Twitter wrote that the platform does not let anything slide.</p><p>Hailey has already been the target of the internet for the past few days as her old antagonism with Selena Gomez was brought up again by fans. Most people stood by Selena and bashed Hailey for being the reason behind <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>Justin</a> and Selena’s breakup. Others also raised questions regarding the Boyfriend singer getting engaged to Hailey soon after his split with Selena Gomez.</p><h2>Internet trolls Hailey Bieber in the midst of her social media strife with Selena Gomez</h2><p>After the photo comparison between Hailey Bieber and Vladimir Putin went viral, many joined the bandwagon and agreed to the post, saying that the two do look alike. Another group of people found an opportunity to mock Hailey even more.</p><p>Selena's fans, who were already furious at Justin Bieber's wife for allegedly throwing shade at the singer, also joined the party to point out how Hailey underwent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>plastic surgery</a> to attain her looks while Selena looked naturally beautiful.</p><p>A few others participated in the fun without taking sides, as they were amused to see the resemblances between the two pictures. One user even wrote that Vladimir <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>Putin</a> looked better than Hailey. Meanwhile, another user answered the rhetorical question that Pop Base asked about a young Vladimir Putin and Hailey Bieber looking alike and wrote that both of them are mean, which is why they look the same.</p><p>The Twitter account that first shared the post replied to the original tweet, posting two more pictures of Putin and Hailey to prove their claim that the two look similar.</p><h3>Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber drama restarted when the singer posted a TikTok videos about her eyebrows</h3><p>The seemingly put-out flames of the feud between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>Selena Gomez</a> and Hailey Bieber were reignited recently in February 2023 after the singer posted a TikTok video joking about how she accidentally laminated her eyebrows too much.</p><p>A few hours later, Kylie Jenner, who is close friends with Hailey, shared an Instagram story where she posted a photo of herself and placed a text overlay right on her eyebrow that read:</p>“This was an accident?????”<p>Selena's fans immediately connected the dots and assumed that Kylie's post was an indirect reply to Selena's TikTok. Later, Kylie shared another Instagram story where she posted a screenshot of her FaceTime with Hailey Bieber, focusing on both of their eyebrows.</p><p>Fans took hints from the two subsequent posts by Kylie Jenner and alleged that Hailey, along with her friends, was throwing shade at the singer. Kylie addressed the speculation and said that her posts had nothing to do with Selena's TikTok as she did not even come across the singer's video.</p><p>Even Selena Gomez said that she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>Kylie</a>'s fan. However, the singer's fans were not convinced, as they kept calling out Hailey Bieber and her friends for bullying Selena.</p><p>Though neither of the two either confirmed or denied the rumors of a recent feud between themselves, Selena told her fans that she was going to take a break from social media as she was too old for this social media drama.</p><p>Selena's fans also analyzed Justin Bieber and Hailey's marriage, arguing that the Honest singer looked unhappy in the pictures of his 29th birthday celebration this March. Some even rumored that Hailey was moving out of Justin's house. However, none of these rumors had any concrete basis as neither of the three commented on the real nature of their relationship with one another.</p><p>More from Sportskeeda</p>" modalPopup.closeOnEsc = false; modalPopup.setHeader("Why did you not like this content?"); modalPopup.setContentText(modalText); modalPopup.addCancelOkButton("Submit", resetRatingAndFeedbackForm, sendRating); modalPopup.removeCloseModalIcon(); modalPopup.disableDismissPopup(); modalPopup.open(); } else { sendRating(index); } } function sendRating() { var requestPayload = { "post_id": 1427476, "rating_value": ratingValue } if (ratingValue > 3) { requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = null; requestPayload.rating_feedback = null; } else { if (!$('input[name="drone"]:checked') || !$('input[name="drone"]:checked').value) { showErrorMessage('option'); return; } if (!$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea") || !$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value) { showErrorMessage('note'); return; } var selectedOption = $('input[name="drone"]:checked').value; var feedbackNote = $(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value; requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = selectedOption; requestPayload.rating_feedback = feedbackNote; } pureJSAjaxPost(addratingAPI, requestPayload, onsaveRatingSuccess, onsaveRatingFail, function() {}, true); } function resetRatingAndFeedbackForm() { var activeStars = Array.from($all('.rating span.rating-star.active')); for (var i=0; i &lt; activeStars.length; i++) { activeStars[i].classList.remove("active"); } if ($('input[name="drone"]:checked')) { $('input[name="drone"]:checked').checked = false; } var userNote = document.querySelector(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea"); userNote.value = ''; modalPopup.close(); } function onsaveRatingSuccess() { modalPopup.close(); savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie(); $("#post-rating-layout").classList.add("hidden"); $("#post-rating-message").classList.remove("hidden"); window.setInterval(function showMessage() { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.add("hidden"); }, 3000); } function onsaveRatingFail() { console.error('Saving post rating failed!'); modalPopup.close(); } function savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie() { userRatedPostIds.push(1427476); var expiryTime = new Date(); expiryTime.setMonth(expiryTime.getMonth() + 12); // Expiry after 1 year setCookie("user_rated_post_ids", JSON.stringify(userRatedPostIds), expiryTime); } function isPostRatedByUser() { var userRatedPostIds = getCookie('user_rated_post_ids'); if (userRatedPostIds) { try { userRatedPostIds = JSON.parse(userRatedPostIds); } catch (err) { console.error(err); return false; } } else { return false; } if(userRatedPostIds.indexOf(1427476) >= 0) { return true; } else { return false; } } function getRatingCountByPostId(postId) { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { pureJSAjaxGet( getRatingCountBaseURL + postId + '/rating/count', function(data) { try { data = JSON.parse(data); if (data.meta_value) { resolve(data.meta_value); } reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } catch (err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } }, function(err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); }, true); }); } function showErrorMessage(messageType) { var messageContainerId = '#' + messageType + '-error'; $(messageContainerId).classList.remove('hidden'); window.setInterval(function () { $(messageContainerId).classList.add("hidden"); }, 5000); } (function() { var callFired = false; function lazyLoadPostRating() { if (callFired) return; callFired = true; if (!isPostRatedByUser()) { getRatingCountByPostId(1427476) .then(function(ratingCount) { if (ratingCount &lt; 10) { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.remove("hidden"); } }) .catch(function(err){ console.error(err); }); } } document.addEventListener("scroll", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("mousemove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("touchmove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); })();<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6uso5WasaJ6wqikaKifpXqkwcutrKudX5m8rq3Ip5ZvZZyawW6tzbKroaGenHq0uMidnGagkZ65psWMm6CempWneq27zqSqZqSZoLJuvNStoKdlpJ64tbvKZp6onaNiw6q%2BwKVkmqWZmXqwusaooKefXaiyrbHNmmSgp52ax26w0Zqkmg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
