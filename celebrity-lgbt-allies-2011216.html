Love her for her not what I want her to be.” He also explained why it was important for him to address trolls about the topic.</p><p>“I thought of erasing [the derogatory comments] but I need the world to see the ignorance that still exists,” the actor explained. “Objective without obstacles is a worthless triumph. We all will some day get to unconditional love. Because of my daughter I am one step closer. I am not God, i don’t judge i just LOVE. And still pray for the haters because i refuse to judge them too just love.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gaga, meanwhile,<a href=#> often speaks out</a> about her “moral obligation” to defend gay rights and accept people for who they are.
