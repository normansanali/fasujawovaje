For example, Lorne Michaels cared about Farley so much that <a href=#>he fired Chris from SNL in an attempt to force him to get the help he needed</a> to save his life. When Farley’s life eventually ended, several of his celebrity friends took his loss especially hard.</p><h2 id=tom-arnold-deeply-regretted-not-being-able-to-help-chris-farley-more><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Tom Arnold Deeply Regretted Not Being Able To Help Chris Farley More</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Chris Farley lost his life, the beloved actor reportedly tried to defeat his addictions by going to rehab 17 times. While Farley ultimately lost that battle, several people in his life tried to help him. For example, Tom Arnold became Chris Farley’s sponsor after Lorne Michaels asked him to help Chris. As a result, Arnold and Farley became so close that Chris was Tom’s best man at his wedding. While talking to Howard Stern about his relationship with Farley in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold stated that he was “very sad when he died”</a>. While that may seem like an underwhelming quote, the revealing thing is that Arnold expressed how Upset he was that Farley began avoiding accountability by staying away from Tom. "It's also frustrating, because at a certain point he's like, I'm not going to be around Tom because I don't want him to see."</p><h2 id=bob-odenkirk-is-still-mad-about-chris-farley-decades-later><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Bob Odenkirk Is Still Mad About Chris Farley Decades Later</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On December 18th, 2022, it will be the twenty-fifth anniversary of Chris Farley’s untimely demise. In the years since Farley took his last breath, most people who knew him best have celebrated his memory and legacy. While Bob Odenkirk has done that, it also is notable that when Odenkirk talks about Farley passing to this day, it is clear that he remains angry about what his friend did to himself. For example, when Odenkirk was interviewed for the documentary I Am Chris Farley, he spent a lot of time talking about how great Farley was. However, in the end, Odenkirk was blunt when talking about Farley’s passing. “With Chris, there is a limit to how wonderful it is to me and that limit is when you kill yourself with drugs and alcohol. You know. That’s when it stops being so f***ing magical.” Based on how upset Odenkirk still is about Farley’s passing, it is very clear that his friend’s death was very hard on him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bob Odenkirk Feels 'SNL' Abused Chris Farley</a></span></p><h2 id=tim-meadows-still-gets-emotional-talking-about-chris-farley><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tim Meadows Still Gets Emotional Talking About Chris Farley</span></h2><p>In 2021, Tim Meadows appeared on the podcast The Three Questions with Andy Richter and during that conversation, it was revealed that he was extremely close with his SNL co-star Chris Farley. While talking about their friendship, Meadows begins telling an anecdote about how much Farley cherished starring in SNL and the emotion in Tim’s voice is palpable. “He looks over at me and he goes ‘Timmy, can you believe this?’ And I was like ‘No, I can’t believe it’. And he goes ‘We’re on Saturday Night Live’. And I was like “Yeah, I know, I know’. And then he goes ‘Let’s just do this one time’ and he hugs me real tight”. “He was such a great guy, man. I miss him. I think about him every day.” Based on how much Meadows clearly still loves Farley to this day, it is easy to imagine how devastated Tim was when Chris died.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-sandler-still-tries-to-keep-chris-farley-rsquo-s-memory-alive-even-though-it-is-hard-on-him><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Adam Sandler Still Tries To Keep Chris Farley’s Memory Alive Even Though It Is Hard On Him</span></h2><p>In the years since Adam Sandler became a major movie star, it has been very clear that he doesn’t take himself seriously. On top of that, Sandler has never been the kind of star to tell emotional stories in public. With that in mind, it is extremely meaningful that Sandler wrote a tribute song to Chris Farley that he performed during an episode of Saturday Night Live. On top of that, it says even more that Sandler revealed that when he rehearsed singing the Farley song on SNL’s stage, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was overwhelmed with emotion</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was scheduled, but it kind of got sprung on me quick. I had to mentally get ready because when I was singing the Farley song in the studio in rehearsals, I kept getting really upset because I loved just being in 8H — the studio. It was making me upset.” "I couldn't really sing it out loud,” Sandler said in the interview. “I was kind of mumbling because his image and stuff was making me off and upset. I was like, 'Oh man, I got to prepare for this — for the show — to try not to break down.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Little-Known Facts About Adam Sandler’s Time On SNL</a></span></p><h2 id=stephen-colbert-described-falling-apart-when-hen-learned-of-chris-farley-rsquo-s-passing><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Stephen Colbert Described Falling Apart When Hen Learned Of Chris Farley’s Passing</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that Stephen Colbert rose to fame many years after Chris Farley passed away, a lot of people have no idea how the two performers knew each other. As it turns out, Colbert and Farley joined the Second City comedy troupe on the same day. As a result, the two men became so close that Colbert once revealed in a tweet that he “fell to the ground” upon hearing about Farley’s passing.</p><h2 id=david-spade-was-so-devastated-by-chris-farley-rsquo-s-passing-that-he-couldn-rsquo-t-deal-with-it><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>David Spade Was So Devastated By Chris Farley’s Passing That He Couldn’t Deal With It</span></h2><p>Over the years, Chris Farley and David Spade performed together so much that some people consider them to be <a href=#>one of the best Hollywood duos of all time</a>. As a result, many people were shocked when it was revealed that Spade didn’t attend Farley’s funeral. Years later when Spade took part in a Reddit AMA, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David explained why he skipped the funeral</a>. “I think people misunderstood me not going to that funeral. It was nothing about that; it was just too ... emotional, and I wouldn't be able to handle it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When David Spade was interviewed for the documentary I Am Chris Farley, he yet again made it clear that he found it extremely difficult to cope with his friend’s passing. “It took months before I could go, ‘OK, I can talk about this.’ It comes up in my life every day, and I think it will forever.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Was The Original Voice Of Shrek Before Mike Myers?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqHqnrdGlnLKrXZmyosDHZp%2BirF2ptaa%2FxGaanqSVl7%2BqwNhmnauhlaOxtHnHmqmdZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
