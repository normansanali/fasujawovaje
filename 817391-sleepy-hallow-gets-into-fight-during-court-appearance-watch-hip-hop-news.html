The rapper was arrested on a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">140-count indictment</a> in 2023, and subsequently released on bail. He's still awaiting a proper trial, which is why he was due for a court appearance on June 18. Unfortunately, the standard operating procedure was thrown out of the window when Hallow got into a physical altercation with an unidentified man. The rapper fought with the man in front of several stunned onlookers. One of them even captured the incident on camera.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the video, Sleepy Hallow can be seen attacking a man who'd already fallen to the floor. Courtroom security tries to pull the rapper off the man, but he gets an extra kick in before being restrained. The incident grew even more chaotic, however, as Hallow's resistance led to several officers falling to the ground themselves. A second video appears to capture the aftermath of the fight, as Sleepy Hallow is seen wearing handcuffs and behaving noticeably more calm. The voice of a shocked onlooker can be heard saying: "This is the stupidest sh*t I seen in my life." It's unclear what the legal repercussions for Sleepy Hallow's behavior will be.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sleepy-hallow-was-handcuffed-following-the-incident>Sleepy Hallow Was Handcuffed Following The Incident</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Hallow has become more known for his public antics than his music in recent months. The NY rapper made a highly-publicized appearance at <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Donald Trump's presidential rally</a> in May alongside Sheff G. Sheff G did most of the talking, but Sleepy Hallow made it clear that he was a fan of Trump when he stepped to the microphone and uttered the President's slogan: "Make American great again," to an excited crowd.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Sleepy Hallow's behavior has been criticized by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez. The D.A. felt it was imperative that rappers like Hallow and Sheff G be punished for their organized crimes. "They take people out, and they’re able to spend money," Gonzalez told the Associated Press. "And they’re able to encourage others to do some of the gang violence that’s just critically important to them and their status in the community." Hallow previously served eight months in prison for weapons possession.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Danilo is a writer based out of San Diego.
