Whether you're streaming a show, using an app, or just trying to chat online with your friends, no platform is immune to the occasional widespread glitch. Usually, they appear as an outage, where thousands of users will be unable to log on or use an app properly without it crashing or simply not working."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Roblox is a popular online gaming platform where users can create avatars and have them traverse a virtual world to play all sorts of user-generated games.</p><p>It's a neat concept to have your own user-generated avatars participate in some fun games, but things get weird when a glitch starts affecting everyone. Rather than an outage, however, Roblox <a href=#>avatars</a> started appearing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bald</a>. Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is everyone bald in 'Roblox'?</h2><p>Like any game with a character creator, users can customize the appearance of their Roblox avatars. Depending on the perks you unlock or the technical know-how you can utilize you can change and mod your character to look however you want. Most everyone has the same blocky avatar, but you can still adjust their skins and outward appearance to your liking. Namely, you can add hair or headgear to your avatar. You even have the option of not wearing anything on your head at all.</p><p>However, a particularly strange glitch in Roblox forced a significant number of players to forcibly appear bald. Starting on Apr. 4, several users took to platforms like Twitter to report that their characters were bald for seemingly no reason. The glitch had apparently spread to several players.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Try Hard Guides</a> reported that it was simply an "unexpected" but "temporary glitch," which can plague any platform from time to time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>omg Roblox just broke and its giving everyone free bald haircuts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ðŸ˜¯ðŸ’€ðŸª’ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AtnzL2JRd6</a></p>â€” Captain Steve (COMISSION CLOSED)ðŸ§¢ ðŸ”¥ (@CaptainSteve_RB) <a href=#>April 4, 2023</a></figure><p>One user on Twitter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">theorized</a> that anyone using the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">R15 avatar body</a> may be subject to this glitch. Roblox offers a variety of avatar bodies that come with different features and animation, but that R15 specifically was the one affected by the bald glitch.</p><p>This could easily have been an April Fool's joke, but the timing of this glitch is certainly fool's-worthy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJ6ulafGsLrEZpmapJRitq950aiZpaeo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
