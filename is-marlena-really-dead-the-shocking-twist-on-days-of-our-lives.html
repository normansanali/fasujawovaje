The Shocking Twist on Days of Our Lives</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-07-06</div><p>Marlena Evans, the beloved heroine of Days of Our Lives, has been pronounced dead after being poisoned by a mysterious toxin. However, many fans are wondering if she is really gone for good, or if there is a chance that she will come back to life. In this article, we will examine the clues and evidence that suggest that Marlena is not really dead, and what it means for the future of the show.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Toxin Scandal</h3><p>The toxin scandal that has rocked Salem began when a mysterious package was delivered to the hospital, containing a vial of a deadly substance. The vial was accidentally broken by a nurse, releasing the toxin into the air. The toxin affected several people who were in the hospital at the time, including Marlena, Kate, Kayla, and Sarah. The toxin caused them to experience hallucinations, seizures, and eventually death.</p><p>However, some fans have noticed that the toxin seems to have different effects on different people. For example, Kate and Kayla died almost immediately after being exposed to the toxin, while Marlena and Sarah lasted longer. Moreover, some fans have pointed out that the toxin may not be lethal at all, but rather a powerful sedative that induces a coma-like state. According to Soap Dirt, the toxin may be part of a sinister plot by someone who wants to kidnap the victims and use them for their own purposes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Heaven Twist</h3><p>Another clue that Marlena is not really dead is the heaven twist that occurred in the recent episodes. After Marlena died in John’s arms, she woke up in a bright and peaceful place, where she was greeted by her old friends Kate and Kayla, who had also died from the toxin. The three women realized that they were in heaven, and that they had a chance to say goodbye to their loved ones before moving on to the next phase of their existence.</p><p>However, some fans have speculated that the heaven scenes are not real, but rather a part of the hallucinations caused by the toxin. According to Soap Hub, the heaven scenes may be a way for the victims to cope with their trauma and pain, and to find closure with their past. Alternatively, the heaven scenes may be a manipulation by the person behind the toxin, who wants to make the victims believe that they are dead, and to prevent them from fighting back.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The History of Resurrections</h3><p>A final clue that Marlena is not really dead is the history of resurrections on Days of Our Lives. The show is known for bringing back characters from the dead, sometimes multiple times. Marlena herself has been presumed dead several times in the past, only to return alive and well. For example, in 1987, she was shot by Orpheus and put on a plane that exploded, but she survived and was held captive by Stefano. In 2004, she was killed by the Salem Stalker, but she and the other victims were found alive on a deserted island. In 2018, she was shot by Kristen, but she recovered after receiving a heart transplant.</p><p>Therefore, it is possible that Marlena will come back from the dead once again, and that her death is part of a bigger storyline that will reveal the truth behind the toxin scandal. According to Soaps In Depth, Deidre Hall, the actress who plays Marlena, has not announced her departure from the show, and she is still under contract. This suggests that she will continue to appear on the show, either in the heaven scenes or in a surprise comeback.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Marlena Evans is one of the most popular and iconic characters on Days of Our Lives, and her death has left many fans heartbroken and angry. However, there are several clues and evidence that indicate that she is not really dead, and that she will return to the show in the near future. Whether she is in heaven, in a coma, or in a secret location, Marlena is not gone for good, and she will reunite with her family and friends soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBuucCro56mkWK%2Fpq3LpbBmnJWWsW7Ax55krKCfmLiqusZmq7Cho6l6sLqMnZiyq12ks2671KtkpaGmmsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
