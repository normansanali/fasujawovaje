Pippen was famously a part of two different three-peats in the 90s with the Bulls and was born in Hamburg, Arkansas on September 25, 1965. As an outstanding athlete with many accomplishments on his record, Pippen's financial trajectory has been a source of fascination for many.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Rise of a Basketball Icon</h2><p>Pippen's basketball information journey, naturally, runs deeper than a clip of him as a college player turning Alcorn State into an afterthought. That includes two years at the University of Central Arkansas that first resulted in the 6-7 forward – with a towering wingspan, a high motor, and the ability to do a little bit of everything – catching scouts' attention. This would then get him selected by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1987 NBA Draft before getting traded to the Chicago Bulls where he would go on to be one of the greatest basketball players of all time.<br data-mce-fragment=1>One of the most formidable tandems the game has ever seen, Pippen and Michael Jordan led the Bulls to six championships in the 1990s and enjoyed heaps of success. A defensive monster who sacrificed for his team at both ends of the floor, Pippen was the perfect complement to the untouchable Jordan, rendering his role critical to the Bulls' success.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Taking on Financial Accusations</h2><p>During his storied career, he fell into financial dire straits when reports emerged alleging that he was bankrupt. The allegations emerged in 2011, claiming Pippen filed for bankruptcy, sparking a legal fight against multiple media outlets for libel.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Though Miner made the rounds denying these considerable accusations, the process of being cleared of a crime was fraught with legal difficulties. The defamation case filed by Pippen for $10 million broke the Supreme Court to see if it could be reignited, but a motion was denied. The lower courts ruled that Pippen, as a public figure, could not establish the reports were made with actual malice, meaning the reports were known to be false or published with reckless disregard for the truth.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Media companies were "highly sophisticated entities which function both to create news and entertainment for the public and to profit from their creation [and] acted in malice by refusing to correct the false reports or remove them," Pippen argued, illustrating the challenges of managing one's public image and correcting the record in the digital age.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Lesson In Finances&nbsp;</h2><p>His finances may have been one of the casualties of the legal battles, but his courage and determination remain intact. Despite struggles, Pippen has carved out a successful post-basketball career. He moved into roles such as television sports analyst, goodwill ambassador for the Chicago Bulls, and product endorser. His title as a special advisor to the president and COO of the Bulls is further proof of his staying power in the business.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Pippen's odyssey stands as a powerful illustration of the burden the cash good causes and the value of overseeing and safeguarding one's money-related brand when the realities do not go your direction.</p><h2>In the End</h2><p>After all, the story of Scottie Pippen stretches far beyond the basketball court to provide headline-taking lessons on where sports, fame, and big paycheques collide. The fact that, even drowning in financial trouble, he never once wavered in trying to clear his name, says more about his steeliness, and what we didn't know about the accusations levied against him in his life, than about his finances.<br data-mce-fragment=1>The below provides a glimpse into the complex financial struggles athletes encounter, the need to separate fact from media fiction, and the nuances of financial damage control — a perhaps surprising, yet balanced view on media cover of how famous athletes have money trouble and why the truth may be deceiving.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfmbaledKcpq2smZp6sbXPqZynZZekeqOtzaSprqikYq5urtGemKScn6y7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
