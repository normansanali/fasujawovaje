How I Met Your Mother was a pop culture phenomenon during its nine-season run, and in the years that followed. It’s also a series that has <a href=#>brought about as many laughs</a> as it did tears.</p><p>Created by <strong>Carter Bays</strong> and <strong>Craig Thomas</strong>, How I Met Your Mother told leading man Ted Mosby’s (<a href=#><strong>Josh Radnor</strong></a>) love story in reverse — ultimately leading up to the moment where he meets the mother of his children. Radnor starred alongside <a href=#><strong>Alyson Hannigan</strong></a> (Lily Aldrin), <a href=#><strong>Jason Segel</strong></a> (Marshall Eriksen), <a href=#><strong>Neil Patrick Harris</strong></a> (Barney Stinson) and <a href=#><strong>Cobie Smulders</strong></a> (Robin Scherbatsky).</p><p>The series, which ran on CBS from 2005 to 2014, also featured the late bob <a href=#>Bob Saget</a> narrating as a future version of Ted Mosby.</p><p>“Something about How I Met Your Mother was [that] it always upended your expectations,” Radnor told <a href=#>HuffPost Live</a> in 2016. “It always made you cry, it always was not what you thought it was.”</p><p>The acclaimed show’s ending was plotted out years in advance. However, when HIMYM wrapped in 2014, longtime fans <a href=#>voiced their disappointment for the series finale</a> due to its controversial ending.</p><p>Four years later, Smulders spoke out in defense of the sitcom’s final moments. “I will say, I’ve had people tell me when they binge watch it [now], they don’t really have a problem with the ending,” she told <a href=#>Newsweek</a> in December 2018. “It makes sense to them. That is what our creator sort of intended from the beginning.”</p><p>Shortly after the show concluded, it was announced that <a href=#>a spinoff series titled How I Met Your Dad was in the works</a> at CBS with Bays, Thomas and <strong>Emily Spivey</strong>. The project was ultimately scrapped, but This Is Us coexecutive producers <strong>Isaac Aptaker</strong> and <strong>Elizabeth Berger</strong> were then tapped to take on the project two years later.</p><p>Aptaker and Berger, however, soon found themselves too busy to juggle developing the sitcom spinoff after being promoted to executive producers/co-showrunners on This Is Us. The following year, <strong>Alison Bennett</strong> — a writer and producer known for FX’s You’re the Worst — subsequently took over.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>The spinoff was officially confirmed</a> in April 2021, with <a href=#><strong>Hilary Duff</strong></a> in the lead role. The series cast <a href=#><strong>Francia Raisa</strong></a>, <strong>Tom Ainsley</strong>, <strong>Tien Tran</strong>, <strong>Surah Sharma</strong>, <strong>Chris Lowell</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Josh Peck</strong></a> and <strong>Daniel Augustin</strong> before filming started in August 2021.</p><p>Scroll down to see where the How I Met Your Mother cast is now:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BdvLh5yGaknqxdrry2voympq2glad6pK3SrWSwoJWnsm6t0Z5kraCVrnqvu9Zo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
