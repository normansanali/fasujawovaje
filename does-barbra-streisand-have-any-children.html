She and Elliott Gould were quite the famous couple before divorcing in 1971. In the late ‘90s, she married actor James Brolin, and the two have been together ever since. But have these unions yielded any children? Streisand has publicized her love for some children, but these are fur babies and not of the human variety. The Funny Girl actor’s beloved Coton de Tulear, named Samantha, was a constant companion until she died in 2017. But Streisand was not ready to let her go and wasted no time cloning the dog.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>You read that right. Streisand’s current dogs — Miss Violet and Miss Scarlett — were cloned from Samantha’s cells, as she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>.</p><p>“They have different personalities. I’m waiting for them to get older so I can see if they have her [Samantha’s] brown eyes and seriousness.”</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>Considering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Streisand’s net worth</a> and her love for her furry companion, money seemed to be no object in this case.

But she also has a legacy in her children. The Way We Were star shares one son with Gould, born in 1966. Per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People Magazine</a>, Streisand reflected in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her memoir, My Name Is Barbra</a>, that she hadn’t expected this to be a turn that her life would take.</p><p>“The news was a shock. For years I had honestly thought there was something wrong with me because I had never gotten pregnant. Having a baby seemed like something for other women, not for me.”</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>Not much is known about Jason Gould, as he doesn’t like being directly in the limelight. With such famous parents, no one can really blame him. Only in recent years has Streisand’s son branched out into entertainment. In 2012, he started performing with his mother on stage, despite reservations that the two voices would be compared. But he stayed the course and released an album of his own in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>In addition to her biological son, Streisand also has three stepchildren through her relationship with Brolin. Brolin had Jess and equally as successful&nbsp;Dune&nbsp;actor, Josh, with his first wife, Jane Cameron Agee. He would later have Molly with his second wife, Jane Smithers. Brolin and Streisand have no children together but have a blended household of dogs and humans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxsLHSZpmaqpKnrm6%2F06ucoquRo7FutMCvnGaZnq56pLTIpZurnZ5k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
