The Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock has eight ports and provides a comprehensive collection of eight current USB Type-C and legacy USB Type-A connectors along with a 2.5GbE. One of the main selling points of the dock is support for enterprise-grade features. But, perhaps most notably, the dock does not have a Surface Connect port.</p><p>Microsoft's&nbsp;<a href=#>Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock</a>&nbsp;connects to a compatible host featuring USB4/Thunderbolt 4 and comes with three 10 Gbps USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A connectors and three 40 Gbps Thunderbolt 4/USB4-certified USB Type-C ports that are accompanied by 2.5GbE and a TRRS audio connector for headsets. The docking station can support two 4Kp60 monitors and various bandwidth hungry TB3/TB4/USB4 peripherals such as storage and eGFX external GPU boxes.</p><p>Also, the unit has an internal power supply that can feed its host up to 96W of power, which is enough to power a high-end 15 or 16-inch laptop. Yet, it cannot feed more than 15W of power over its USB-C ports, so its charging capabilities are pretty limited.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/18802/microsoft-surface-dock-1_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Microsoft stresses that its Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock is different from its previous docks as it can be used with non-Surface USB-C devices, including Windows OEM devices and Apple Macs. As part of this compatibility, the dock lacks the company's proprietary Surface Connect port, which has been a mainstay of Microsoft Surface devices up until now – for better and for worse. Dropping the proprietary port makes it incompatible with older Surface devices that only have a Surface Connect port, such as the&nbsp;Microsoft Surface Book&nbsp;2&nbsp;and the Surface Pro&nbsp;5, but looking at the bigger picture, Microsoft's release of a dock that lacks its own proprietary port may indicate that the company is (finally) dropping it entirely in favor of the more ubiquitous Thunderbolt 4/USB4 connector.</p><p>With its six ports, an audio connector, and a 2.5GbE port, the Microsoft Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock somewhat falls short from being an ultimate docking station (such as&nbsp;<a href=#>13-in-1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>14-in-1</a>&nbsp;docks from OWC). Yet, it looks like its key selling point is not exactly the number of connectors, but rather support for enterprise-grade features, making it a comprehensive choice for commercial customers buying Microsoft Surface or other Windows-based devices.</p><p>In particular, the Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock offers Firmware Update via Windows Update, Wake on LAN from Modern Standby, and MAC Address Pass-Through‎. Additionally, the Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM) allows for easy disabling of the dock ports in mission-critical environments and limits functionality to specific devices‎ (e.g., one can plug in a monitor, a keyboard or a webcam, but cannot use a USB drive).</p><p>Microsoft's Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock will be available shortly directly from Microsoft as well as from its resellers for $299.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH55hI9rZqahk6e8tLvFrWSlmaWjsKmx0maroa2embKzrs6lq2ZsXajCs7LAnJxmnJ%2BYuG6%2FwKeqZpufo7umr9Nmp6iqpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
