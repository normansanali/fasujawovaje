Aside from coats and jackets, having the right pair of shoes is probably the most important thing to buy.</p><p>If you’re looking for some great winter boots, UGG is always a brand that we like to turn to. We know exactly what to expect when we buy a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">pair of UGGs</a>, and we actually found some on sale for less than $100 on Nordstrom!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/UGG-Classic-Mini-Fluff-Black.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><span class=ou>UGG&nbsp;</span></a><span class=pu><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Classic Mini Fluff</a> winter boots (originally $160) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$99</a>, available at Nordstrom!</span></strong></p><p>This pair of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">mini UGG boots</a> are the real deal. They’re the perfect shoes to keep your feet warm while out and about on a cold wintery day. They’re lined with ultra-soft sheepskin and are made for all-day comfort. What’s different about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">this pair</a>, in particular, is that the lining folds down that create a cuff, which gives them an adorable look.</p><p>These <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">UGG boots</a> come in four different colors to choose from: black, grey, burgundy and chestnut brown. The former three colors all have fur that matches the color of the shoe, while the brown pair features white fur that contrasts with the hue nicely.
