He recently returned during the WWE is XXX special for another appearance on WWE television, but it turns out he still isn’t getting around too well behind the scenes.</p><p>During the<a href=#> Kurt Angle Show</a>, the WWE Hall of Fame Olympian explained that he spoke to Hulk Hogan at the RAW is XXX show. Hogan seems to be doing well as he caught up with old colleagues.</p><p>“I did speak to Hulk Hogan for a bit of time for about a half hour, and I also spoke to Undertaker for about a half hour. Those two guys are the two guys that I wanted to catch up with when I went there, so I was very happy to be able to do that.”</p><p>Kurt Angle continued as he explained that Hulk Hogan had another back surgery. Due to that operation, the nerves in his lower body were cut. Now, he walks with a cane and The Hulkster cannot feel anything. The good news is that he has no pain at all. The bad news is that it’s pretty serious.</p><p>“Hogan had his back surgery again. He had the nerves cut from his lower body. He can’t feel his lower body, so he has to use his cane to walk around. I thought he was using the cane because he has pain in his back. He doesn’t have any pain. He has nothing at all. He can’t feel anything. So now he can’t feel his legs, so he has to walk with a cane. That’s pretty serious, man. I mean, I really feel for Hogan. He put his heart and soul into the business, and it ate him up.”</p><p>Hulk Hogan has made no secret about his numerous back issues, which included many surgeries. It seems that all of that work on his back had some unintended results. Hopefully, Hulk Hogan has much better luck with his health down the line.</p><p>We’ll have to see when Hulk Hogan shows up on WWE television once again. If anything, he has WrestleMania right around the corner. Keep checking back with <a href=#>Ringside News</a> for more.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this situation?
