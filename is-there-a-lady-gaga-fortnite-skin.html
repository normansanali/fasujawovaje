Alongside his music being available within the game, The Weeknd was also made into a skin that users could don while playing a round of Battle Royale. Now, Fortnite has announced the headliner for its 2024 festival, and it’s time for gamers the world over to put their paws up.</p><h2 id=h-is-there-a-lady-gaga-fortnite-skin data-injectable=false>Is there a Lady Gaga Fortnite skin?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>*fortnite <a href=#>https://t.co/1FwPHmMfRJ</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9BSG6S23zh</a></p>— Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) <a href=#>February 20, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>Taking to X (formerly known as Twitter) on February 21, Lady Gaga shared an image of herself in the form of a Fortnite avatar. The graphic was accompanied by a caption in which Gaga replied to her own years-old Tweet with the question: “What’s fortnight?”. It appears the singer has since discovered what all the fuss was about in 2019, amending the spelling error and attaching a visual of herself in full Fortnite form</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Chromatica Armor Lady Gaga Outfit will be in the item shop until April 22.<a href=#>#Fortnite</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ptn9lqzCWq</a></p>— Wenso (@Wensoing) <a href=#>February 21, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>The post is Gaga’s official announcement of her collaboration with the video game as part of the 2024 Fortnite Festival. The second season of the festival, which arrives on February 22, will now include select songs from Gaga’s discography. The singer’s 2008 hit “Bad Romance” did appear as part of Fortnite Festival, and the following tracks have now been confirmed:</p><ul data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false><li>Applause</li><li>Bloody Mary</li><li>Born This Way</li><li>The Edge of Glory</li><li>Just Dance</li><li>Rain on Me</li><li>Stupid Love</li></ul><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>In the vein of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guitar Hero</a>, this means Fortnite players can use Gaga’s tracks for various functions within the game, and presumably use her skin — which seems inspired by her 2020 album Chromatica — during gameplay. It’s unclear whether Gaga’s headlining role will play out like The Weeknd’s, or if Fortnite will draw from their separate music collaborations and in-game concerts with Scott or Grande.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Fortnite Festival is billed as a music-driven game allowing Fortnite users to “play through a licensed soundtrack of some global hits,” according to Epic’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>. Alongside Fortnite, Gaga’s music has appeared in fellow video game soundtracks including various editions of Just Dance and a 2014 re-release of Grand Theft Auto V.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=false>The news comes as Gaga — who is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">set to star as Harley Quinn</a> in the Joker sequel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Folie á Deux</a> — has begun teasing a new album on social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZooKxlpJ2ys7GMmmSlmZSueqitxppkn6eiqbuqwMRmqqShnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
