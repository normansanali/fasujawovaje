But it turns out, she loves nothing more than a simple corn dog. And she’s taken that love to Instagram on more than one occasion. In fact, her appreciation for the snack is so famous, it even got a t-shirt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Reba-McEntire-silver-dress.jpg><h2 id=h-reba-mcentire-s-love-of-corn-dogs-on-a-t-shirt>Reba McEntire’s love of corn dogs on a t-shirt</h2><p id=par-2_36>In 2018, McEntire shared with fans on Instagram that her corn dog had inspired a t-shirt. Previously available in McEntire’s merchandise store, the shirt read: “I want to be loved like Reba loves a corn dog!”</p><p id=par-3_22>In smaller print, the shirt noted the year <a href=#>the country icon</a> launched her career with the line: “Hot & Fresh since 1975.”</p><p id=par-4_27>On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, McEntire wrote of the apparel, “You know I LOVE a corndog!!! Now I’ve got a t-shirt I can wear to show how much I do!”</p><h2 id=h-reba-mcentire-s-instagram-love-for-corn-dogs>Reba McEntire’s Instagram Love for Corn Dogs</h2><p id=par-5_27>Anyone in search of more evidence of McEntire’s corn dog love can look to her Instagram where she’s shared a small collection of corn dog-related snaps.</p><p id=par-6_52>In one post, she called the snacks “heaven,” and fans noted she appears to be enjoying one on a private jet. Maybe McEntire recommends enjoying corn dogs in such luxury if you happen to get the chance to try it, but some of life’s pleasures are reserved for <a href=#>well-established icons</a>.</p><p id=par-7_17>Luckily, in the end, they probably taste just as good no matter where you eat them.</p><h2 id=h-reba-mcentire-introduced-james-corden-to-corn-dogs-who-felt-like-he-was-giving-his-mouth-a-cuddle>Reba McEntire introduced James Corden to corn dogs, who felt like he was ‘giving his mouth a cuddle’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_27>On a 2018 episode of <a href=#>The Late Late Show with James Corden</a>, late-night <a href=#>host James Corden</a> presented McEntire with several pictures of her eating corn dogs.</p><p id=par-9_65>She explained of one picture, ”We had a show down at the Strawberry Festival in Florida, and when I get out of the car before the show starts I go and get ready for the show and everything, and I say ‘I don’t care what happens at this show tonight but you better have me a corn dog when I get back in this car.’”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_32>“And I’m really, really happy there,” she noted of a photo where she holds a corn dog and smiles. She also noted for the record, “I like mustard and ketchup.”</p><p id=par-11_70>Then, Corden admitted that he had never actually had one himself. “I didn’t know what a corn dog was,” he admitted. So, as a treat for McEntire, he presented her and his other guests — Lucy Hale and Glenn Howerton — with one for each of them. “How long’s that been sitting there?” Howerton asked of the plate of corn dogs, to which Corden joked, “A couple of weeks.”</p><p id=par-12_24>When Howerton noted that Corden looked like he didn’t want to eat his, the host hilariously replied, “Well, I don’t know how to.”</p><p id=par-13_34>But McEntire led the way in taking the first bite, and Corden followed her lead. “Oh, it’s sensational!”&nbsp;he shared after taking his first bite.&nbsp;He added, ”I feel like I’m giving my mouth a cuddle.”</p><p id=par-14_17>So, it’s safe to say McEntire’s love of corn dogs is huge — and possibly contagious.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2Fpq7AZqScnZ6ptrOxjJycpZ2Sp661scNmn56qXaG8t7GMqJ1mm5%2Bnu26wzqCqZqeeYravv9OanquZnWO1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
