She’s so caring and sensitive and never forgets a birthday. She’s awesome.”</p><p>As far as his older brother, <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>, the Light of My Life star opened up to Us about the actor’s relationship with Indiana, 15, and Atticus, 11. “[He] is a really great role model for them and the way an uncle should be,” the Boston native said. “He pops in and out and takes them to a game or just whatever.”</p><p>Casey is hoping that his close relationship with the Accountant star, 46, will have a positive influence on his sons. “You can tell your kids what to do, but they don’t really listen. They’re way more likely to be like what they see,” Casey told Us. “They’re going to imitate you. I could tell them not to fight, but I’m going to have a much bigger impact if I’m able to stop the video when me and Ben get into a fight and resolve it.”</p><p>He explained, “I try to let them see those types of things and not just be like, ‘Hey look. Ben and I are great friends. You guys should be great friends too.’”</p><p>While writing his new movie Light of My Life, the Manchester&nbsp;by&nbsp;the Sea star&nbsp;used his time with his sons, <a href=#>whom&nbsp;he shares with his ex-wife, <strong>Summer Phoenix</strong></a>, as inspiration. One of them even gave him direct suggestions.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Casey-Affleck-Keeps-His-Sons-Grounded-still.jpg><p>“When I did a read through of this movie … my son came and listened to it and afterwards he gave me a piece of paper,” Casey told Us. “I was like, ‘What’s this?’ and he had written out [on] both sides of the paper what he was thinking. It was awesome … very smart and very helpful.”</p><p>Light of My Life premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February. The movie will be released in NYC and L.A. theaters on August 2, expanding to 100 screens and video on demand on August 9.</p><p>With reporting by Carly Sloane</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmaOaxm6txZ%2BjnpubYremus2inZ6qXZyus7rEq2Siq12lsrOyxJyrZpmlo8FuwM5mpLJlo6S7tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
