This would have given him a chance to respond to being charged with one count of murder with use of a deadly weapon in relation to the killing of Tupac Shakur in 1996.</p><p>The defendant’s lawyer, however, never showed up. As a result, Keefe D asked the judge for a two-week continuance, which means that his arraignment has been postponed.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/10/suge-knight-refuses-to-testify-against-2pac-murder-suspect-keefe-d-250x142.jpg alt="Suge Knight Refuses To Testify Against 2Pac Murder Suspect Keefe D" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Suge Knight Refuses To Testify Against 2Pac Murder Suspect Keefe D</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>October 3, 2023</p></a><p><a class=underline-link href=#>Davis was taken into police custody on Friday morning</a> (September 29), marking the first ever arrest in the investigation into ‘Pac’s murder, which has remained unsolved for 27 years.</p><p>The development comes a little over two months after <a class=underline-link href=#>police raided the home of the suspect’s wife</a>. Las Vegas police said at the time that they were searching the house “as part of the ongoing Tupac Shakur homicide investigation.”</p><p>Various items were seized during the search, including computers, a cellphone and hard drive, as well as several .40-caliber bullets.

In a 2018 interview, he claimed that his nephew, Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson, was one of two people sitting in the backseat of the car, the area from which the shots were let off.</p><p>2Pac was shot multiple times in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas on September 7, 1996. Six days later, he died in hospital from his injuries, cutting short the life of one of Hip Hop’s most influential figures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mhpqZmTYrimscWeZJ1ln6rBra3Ws2SnmaCkuaa7zQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
