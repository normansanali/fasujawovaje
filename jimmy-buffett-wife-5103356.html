However, Jane wasn’t Jimmy’s first wife. He was married once before he said “I do” to Jane. The “Come Monday” singer walked down the aisle with Margie Washicheck, but the marriage lasted three years before they went their separate ways."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He gave a bit of a rundown, including how he met and separated from Jane, in his 1998 autobiography, A Pirate Looks At Fifty.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I flunked out of college. I learned to play the guitar, lived on the beach, lived in the French Quarter, finally got laid and didn’t go to Vietnam,” he wrote, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a>. “I got back into school, started a band, got a job on Bourbon Street, graduated from college, flunked my draft physical, broke up my band, and went out on the road solo. I signed a record deal, got married, moved to Nashville, had my guitars stolen, bought a Mercedes, worked at Billboard magazine, put out my first album, went broke, met <strong>Jerry Jeff Walker</strong>, wrecked the Mercedes, got divorced, and moved to Key West.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jimmy-Buffett-Wife-5-Things-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I started another band,” he wrote, continuing, “Worked the road, had my second and last hit, bought a house in Aspen, started spending summers in New England, got married, broke my leg three times in one year, had a baby girl, made more records, bought a bigger boat, and sailed away to St. Barts. I got separated from the right girl, sold the boat, sold the house in Aspen, moved back to Key West, worked the road, and made more records. I rented an apartment in Paris, went to Brazil for Carnival, learned to fly, went into therapy, quit doing dope, bought my first seaplane, flew all over the Caribbean, almost got a second divorce, moved to Malibu for more therapy, and got back with the right girl.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Jimmy fell in love with Jane when she was a student at the University of South Carolina, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>. Jane was a strong influence on Jimmy, helping him adopt a more professional approach to his music, and she even became his muse.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>While on tour, he was spending time in his hotel room when he missed his wife so much that <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he wrote her a song</a>. That tune would be “Come Monday,” a Top 40 hit for Jimmy. Jane also appeared in the music video.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The timing of Jimmy and Jane’s romance is unclear. While many publications list their first meeting in 1976, Jimmy’s “Come Monday” was a hit in 1974.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>However, the couple took time apart during their marriage. He and his wife separated in the 1980s.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“I had been with Jimmy since I was a child, through the craziest times,” she said in 1998, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Showbiz Cheatsheet</a>. “And I didn’t have a clue who I was. So I left. I got sober.” The couple reconciled in 1991 and have been together ever since.”</p><h2><strong>Who Is Margie Washichek?</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Little is known about Jimmy Buffett’s first wife, <strong>Margie Washichek</strong>. The two were reportedly married from 1969 to 1971 (or ’72, the date is not clear). The union produced no children, and Jimmy did not share many details about the experience during his lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mipKaxXZfCp7LEratmr5mbsm6BkGlqbG1mZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
