One of the show’s executive producers revealed in a new interview that danger is on the horizon for <a href=#>Katic’s Kate Beckett</a> and <b>Nathan Fillion’s</b> Richard Castle in the season 8 finale.</p><p>“There is death in every episode of Castle. We don’t want to get into that too much. There’s definitely danger,” Alexi Hawley told <a href=#><i>Entertainment Weekly</i>.</a> “Their lives are in jeopardy pretty much from [the] jump. What we wanted to do was keep pulling the rug out from under them. Things get dangerous very fast. Ultimately, it’s a back-and-forth between being the hunted and being the hunters all the way through the finale.”</p><p>According to <i>EW,</i>&nbsp;Beckett and Castle will inch closer to finding out more about the mysterious person dubbed LokSat as the season nears an end.</p><p>As fans know by now, Katic, 38, is leaving the crime procedural after the current season. <a href=#>Multiple sources told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>that she and Fillion, 45, are feuding behind closed doors.</p><p>“Stana would cry on set because Nathan was such a bully to her,” a source told <i>Us</i> last month. Added a second insider: “The friction was very evident. Nathan has been nasty to Stana for a long time. Stana was a pro, just wanted to get in there and do her job.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Katic’s rep, meanwhile, told <i>Us</i> that the actress isn’t on bad terms with her costar. According to <i>Deadline,</i>&nbsp;she’s leaving the longstanding series for “budgetary reasons.”</p><p><a href=#>Fillion tweeted about Katic</a> following her shocking departure news. “Stana has been my partner all this time, and I thank her for creating the character of Beckett who will live on for all of us as one of the greatest police officers on television,” he wrote at the time. “I wish her well, and have no doubt she will succeed in everything she pursues. She will be missed.”</p><p>As previously reported, Castle has yet to be renewed for a ninth season. In the meantime, Hawley has made sure to cover all his bases.</p><p>“If we hear that we’re not coming back, we have shot something that we can put at the end of the episode as a way to put a button on everything. Obviously that would be a bad thing because it would mean no more,” Hawley told <i>EW</i>. “We did it in order to try to protect the fans, because you can’t end the series on a cliffhanger.”</p><p>Co-showrunner and executive producer Terence Paul Winter hopes that the footage will never see “the light of day” though. “There will be no more loose ends at the end of the season,” he added. “Everything will be answered; all mysteries from previous years will be wrapped up.”</p><p><i>Castle’</i>s season 8 finale airs on Monday, May 16, on ABC at 10 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6ipJxiwLWtzZpkpJmknrC0ecqaq55lkpqwrLHTrWSdoZVivK9506GcZpuRqMGtsYyfoKeZnJp6uH6PbW5yaF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
