When it finally saw the light of day, Antlers was the subject of average reviews and a sense it was lacking in true del Toro-levels of absurdity.</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Discussion has now returned to the 2021 release, with horror enthusiasts reminiscing on Antlers as deserving more credit. Undoubtedly not helped by its initial release coinciding with Edgar Wright’s Last Night in Soho and del Toro’s own film Nightmare Alley, it’s perhaps no surprise it’s taken this long for Antlers to receive recognition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Just watched Antlers and I think it deserves more credit!</a> from <a href=#>horror</a></figure><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>Antlers features the age-old combination of a strange young boy befriending an otherworldly and bizarre being, and small town politics. Hardly a breathtaking concept, it does see interesting themes within its script. Meant to be an allegory for the opioid epidemic in midwest communities, Antlers was hindered by its overall macabre treatment of its characters. Brutal, to say the least.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-16.png><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>An adaptation of the short story “The Quiet Boy” written by Nick Antosca, there is an obvious issue regarding the length of the 100 minute Antlers, with the ending of the original novella made much more punctual and effective due to its shortened structure.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>The titular monster is also a form of a wendigo, which is always a welcome addition in a rural-set horror film. Give me more wendigos and less poltergeists, Hollywood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-17.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-18.png><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>The cast for Antlers, however, is surprisingly strong. Just around the same time as he entered Academy Awards discussion for The Power of the Dog, Jesse Plemons headlined Antlers alongside Russell, as well as Dazed and Confused star Rory Cochrane.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>The impact of Antlers on the box office and financials is also hard to gauge, with no budget made public and an overall box office of $18 million. In comparison, Nightmare Alley made $39 million, and Last Night in Soho just ahead with $23 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6Kumai2t7GMnKaspZmYeqS%2BxJqrrqqVYrOmrdOuqZ5lkaPBrbHRrGSfoZ6Wua3FjKucnJ2Zq7K0ec%2BrmKKrlWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
