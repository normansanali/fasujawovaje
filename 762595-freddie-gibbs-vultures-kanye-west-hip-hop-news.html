It finally came out this weekend, and just like many fans anticipated, he provided a killer guest verse on the track "Back To Me." Of course, this was one of the first previewed songs that we heard from this project, and it dates back to their first listening event for it. Over a crisp drum break and ethereal vocal samples, the Indiana MC flows wildly over it, displaying why he's one of the best spitters in the game right now. Say what you will about Ye, his collaborators, and the ugly parts of this rollout, release, and platform, but talking strictly about the music, the effort here is undeniable.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What's more is that fans on social media are really excited about <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">finally getting this feature on Vultures after so long</a>. "Freddie Gibbs deserves a lifetime supply of YZY products after giving a verse like that wtf," one user expressed. "Freddie Gibbs took off on this Ye Album. One of my favorite verses so far this year. Lethal," another added, and you can find many more messages like these a little further down below. If you don't have Apple Music (the only platform the album is up on at press time), you can find leaked versions of the cut on YouTube, Twitter, or other social media platforms.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-freddie-gibbs-hops-on-kanye-west-amp-ty-dolla-sign-s-back-to-me>Freddie Gibbs Hops On Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign's "Back to Me"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, there was a point in which Freddie Gibbs' appearance on Vultures was a bit more of a contentious affair. In his rant about wanting to work with Ye and do a better job than his collaborators, JPEGMAFIA ended up <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">taking shots at the Piñata lyricist</a>. This is ironic because Peggy provided production on a couple of tracks on the new album, and all of them are stellar additions. At least this beef didn't result in either artist delivering mediocre performances or contributions.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-fan-reactions-to-the-vultures-cut>Fan Reactions To The Vultures Cut</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, with two more Vultures volumes and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a solo Ye album</a> reportedly on the way, we'll see what other features capture fans' hearts.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdna392hZRmnaudlJm2pnnGopmbq12rwq3A1KucrGWblru6sYywnKysXZ22sXnHqKdmppWswA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
