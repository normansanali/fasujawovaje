My kids were surprisingly very supportive.”</p><p>The Bravo star revealed that she and Seth have been “on and off for years,” but were “100 percent private about it” until she joined the Housewives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Real-Housewives-Of-Salt-Lake-City-Star-Meredith-Marks-Marriage-Has-Been-On-and-Off-for-Years-02.jpg><p>“The separations we’ve had have been on and off for years and we’ve even dated other people from time to time,” Meredith explains to <i>Us</i>. “It was not something I really wanted to talk about, but I had to and was forced to talk a lot more than I even wanted to by some of the women and that to me is not being a good friend.”</p><p>She adds, “To me being a good friend is respecting somebody’s space and their privacy when they need it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meredith, who wed Seth in 1996 and share three adult children, Reid, Chloe and Brooks, remained coy when asked about the status of her relationship.</p><p>“I’d rather say that you should watch and see, but I will say we have three beautiful children together. We basically grew up together,” she says to <i>Us</i>. “I mean, we met at 23 years old, so we’re always going to have a relationship together and above and beyond that — watch and see. I want everyone to be invested in my journey. I don’t want to give away any endings.”</p><p><i>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City </i>airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmqaeUmK60wNJonp6spJ67qHnRnpilZaeewal506GcZqCfqsCmw8ivnKxnop28tLjCZqqtmaJiuqa%2BxJ2graBdoq6zt9JmpJqqop6uqLGMoZisZZKasq95zqdkmqaUYrynsoyfpqtlqZqus7%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
