She had an emotional conversation with Williams about her current state, offering her some words of support. During a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, White reflected on her appearance and addressed the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">backlash</a> the doc received.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-blac-chyna-reflects-on-her-where-is-wendy-williams-appearance>Blac Chyna Reflects On Her Where Is Wendy Williams? Appearance</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to White, she's yet to watch the full doc, but feels as though she's seen what she needed to. “I’ve seen certain clips and things like that,” she told the outlet. “I’m the type of person if I see more than what I need to see, I’m gonna have to dig and get to the bottom of certain things. And I’m just like, ‘Whatever for me is supposed to be for me.’" White then went on to reveal that she can relate to Williams' struggle with substance abuse. According to her, the doc has the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">potential to help others</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I definitely think that for me, to be honest, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I think it was definitely necessary to be made</a>... I feel like… People actually do need to see it ’cause it is happening, and it can really, honestly happen to anybody… Maybe this is gonna help other people to see," she explained. "To see Wendy, you know, struggling obviously with the alcohol and her substances over the years, you know, it hurts, and it’s like the alcohol part with me, so it’s like I can relate to that.” What do you think of Blac Chyna's take on Where Is Wendy Williams?
