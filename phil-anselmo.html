While they did have some original material, they played mainly Judas Priest covers.</p><p>Pantera released three albums via Metal Magic Records, but did not garner much attention, because the band wasn’t signed with a major label record at the time, especially with Terry Glaze at vocals. Seeking a new frontman to continue down a heavier path, Glaze, who was primarily a glam metal vocalist, left the band. In 1987, after several meetings, the 19-year old Anselmo was officially added to the Pantera lineup. The band was so impressed with Anselmo, that they re-recorded some of Glaze’s vocals for their latest release.

Following the release of Power Metal, the band dropped its glam image and adopted a more casual look. In 1990, Pantera released their fifth album, Cowboys from Hell, which paved the way towards the band’s stardom.
