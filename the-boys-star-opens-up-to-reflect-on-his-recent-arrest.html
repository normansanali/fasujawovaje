The actor behind everyone’s favorite sadistic superhero had to address the brief real-life episode where he channelled Homelander in a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>, explaining that unlike his character in the Amazon series, he believes in “accountability and taking responsibility.”</p><p>There’s not much point in me re-litigating the facts. They’re out there. They’ve been said. I’ve got nothing to add to that. [I] believe in accountability and taking responsibility. I got myself into a situation that was negative and I reacted poorly, and the way forward from that was very clear. It was quite simply to take ownership of it, which I do, and then really learn from it and move forward. I don’t know anyone that hasn’t, on a personal level, got things that they want to work on. I’ve really just kept this issue to a personal level, because it is a personal issue — a personal issue that I’ve taken responsibility for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wolverine-antony-starr.jpg><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>The actor sounds pretty clear about drawing a line between public opinion and what he deems a “personal issue.” Frankly, it’s a none too unreasonable argument to make, because if this had happened to anyone besides a celebrity of his stature, the news wouldn’t have even made it to page ten.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=false>Antony Starr returns with another exemplary performance as Homelander in the third season of Prime Video’s The Boys.
