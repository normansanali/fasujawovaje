Fortunately for Emily, she's continued in her acting career in a very different direction than where Miley ended up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, <a href=#>the two didn't always get along</a> while they worked together, but the same can't be said for Emily and her next set of close-as-family castmates. After 70+ episodes of 'Young & Hungry,' Emily and her co-stars were sad their series came to an end. But where are they all now?</p><h2 id=what-is-emily-osment-doing-now>What Is Emily Osment Doing Now?</h2><p>Thanks to the success of 'Young & Hungry' (well, and Emily's pure talent), Osment now has a handful of roles with Netflix. Since the show wrapped, she's had recurring roles on various series, with two upcoming in 2021.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Emily Osment And Miley Cyrus' Relationship</a></span></p><p>It seems that Emily has settled into her Netflix gig very well, but what are the rest of her castmates up to?</p><h2 id=jonathan-sadowski-took-a-creative-turn>Jonathan Sadowski Took A Creative Turn</h2><p>Fans might remember Sadowski from 'She's The Man' back in 2006, but Jonathan has grown up since then. 'Young & Hungry' definitely had some adult themes, but Jonathan seems to have embraced even more of those not-so-PG undertones with his newest projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like Emily Osment, he's been on a handful of series since their show wrapped, including his current gig, 'Sex/Life.' But he's also made sure to keep in touch with his former castmates in the meantime, including the <a href=#>recently-married Jesse McCartney</a>.</p><p>Fans will recall that McCartney played Cooper on 'Young & Hungry,' and the two guys seem to have formed a long-lasting friendship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Jesse McCartney Has Been Up To Since 'Beautiful Soul'</a></span></p><p>They're not the only cast members who still get together, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aimee-carrero-tends-to-favor-voice-work>Aimee Carrero Tends To Favor Voice Work</h2><p>Fans loved Aimee Carrero as Sofia in 'Young & Hungry,' but where has she been since? It turns out Aimee favors voice work, and she's actually voiced a Disney princess, too; from 2016 to 2020, she voiced Princess Elena in 'Elena of Avalor.'</p><p>After that, she also voiced She-Ra for a couple of years, before playing another Sofia on the series 'The Village.' She's also joined up with Netflix, like Emily did, and is currently working on 'Maid.'</p><p>But as Emily once noted, the cast of 'Young & Hungry' remains "family," so while Sofia's a busy (and married) lady these days, she still throws it back to her former castmates on occasion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rex-lee-has-faded-from-tv-and-films>Rex Lee Has Faded From TV And Films</h2><p>Unlike most of his former co-stars, Rex Lee doesn't have quite as illustrious a Hollywood resume these days. After 'Young & Hungry,' he seemed to slow down a bit, acting in only two films and a couple of episodes of 'Fresh Off the Boat' in the past few years.</p><p>But he has kept busy, working on a podcast with industry friends, and seems to be happy with hanging back a little bit when it comes to publicity.</p><h2 id=kym-whitley-is-keeping-busy>Kym Whitley Is Keeping Busy</h2><p>Who could forget Yolanda?! Kym Whitley, like the rest of her family from the 'Young & Hungry' cast, has kept plenty busy since the show wrapped. For one thing, Kym has a young son that she's had a hard time keeping up with (he appears to be a ladies' man even in elementary school).</p><p>But Kym has also appeared on a long list of TV shows and in films since her previous serious wrapped. And she's been busy on social media; Kym apparently joined Weight Watchers and is feeling herself even more these days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a fun twist, she's also taken to the stage with fellow comedian Sherrie Shepherd, which is a surprising and intriguing departure from sitcom work. Anyone who was a fan of Yolanda's one-liners will probably want to buy tickets to one of Kym's upcoming shows.</p><p>Fortunately for fans, all of the former cast members of 'Young & Hungry' have a ton of other projects that showcase their talents.</p><h2 id=and-the-show-39-s-guest-stars>And The Show's Guest Stars?</h2><p>Of course, the show also featured additional guest stars like Betty White, Kylie Minogue, and even Ashley Tisdale (Ashley may have <a href=#>lost out on a sought-after role on 'Suite Life'</a> back in the day, but now, she can nab a guest spot on nearly any show).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's clear what those stars have been up to, though. But it's great to know that Emily Osment and the supporting cast members were able to continue growing their careers after their sitcom was unceremoniously ended (and on a cliffhanger, no less).</p><p>Fans still have their fingers crossed for a film, which Osment once said had been discussed, but only time will tell.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here’s What Ashley Tisdale Has Been Up To Since The Success Of ‘High School Musical’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZq6qrjYZqaspZWjwbR5wpqqraWRqbK0ediorKefXZa7pXnHrqWgqqlk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
