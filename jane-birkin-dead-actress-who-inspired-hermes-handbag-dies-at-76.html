Dumas quickly noticed contents from Birkin’s straw purse falling out when she attempted to stow it in the plane’s overhead compartment. After hearing Birkin complain about the bag’s structure, inspiration struck.</p><p class=p1>Hermès created<a href=#> a custom handbag for Birkin</a> three years later, which has since become one of<a href=#> the most coveted luxury accessories</a> in the fashion industry.</p><p class=p1>Birkin carried her one-of-a-kind purse for many years before eventually <a href=#>asking the brand to remove her name</a> from its crocodile-skin handbag in July 2015.</p><p class=p1>“Having been alerted to the cruel practices reserved for crocodiles during their slaughter to make Hermes handbags carrying my name,” Birkin said in a statement at the time. “I have asked Hermes to debaptize <a href=#>the Birkin Croco</a> until better practices in line with international norms can be put in place.”</p><p class=p1>Hermès later told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in a statement that Birkin had alerted them of her concerns regarding the ethical treatment of crocodiles, noting their intentions to launch an investigation into the matter.&nbsp;“Her comments do not in any way influence the friendship and confidence that we have shared for many years,” the brand’s statement read. “Hermès respects and shares her emotions and was also shocked by the images recently broadcast.”</p><p class=p1>They added: “Hermès imposes on its partners <a href=#>the highest standards in the ethical treatment</a> of crocodiles. For more than 10 years, we have organized monthly visits to our suppliers. We control their practices and their conformity with slaughter standards established by veterinary experts and by the Fish and Wildlife (a federal American organization for the protection of nature) and with the rules established under the aegis of the U.N.O, by the Washington Convention of 1973 which defines the protection of endangered species.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The investigation concluded in September 2015 with Birkin telling <a href=#>Reuters</a> in a statement that she was “satisfied” by the brand’s actions.</p><p class=p1>Birkin, who previously <a href=#>suffered a mild stroke</a> in 2021, is survived by her daughters <a href=#><strong>Charlotte</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lou</strong></a>, whom she shared with exes Gainsbourg and <strong>Jacques Doillon</strong>, respectively.
