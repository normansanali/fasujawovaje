She’s talented.”</p><p>Common also listed off all of the accomplishments he required for his girlfriend — including winning an Oscar on her first film, being an <a href=#>EGOT winner</a> and having a talk show — and to no one’s surprise they all applied to Hudson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Why-Common-and-Jennifer-Hudson-Went-Public-With-Romance.jpg><p>“To me, it’s one of those things where I found where seeing her happy actually makes me really happy,” he continued. “I’m very grateful.
